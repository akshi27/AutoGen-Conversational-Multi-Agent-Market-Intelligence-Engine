Some bad gases will also get dissolved in water like SO2, NO2 etc.\n3. Easy to change water, almost free. HEPA filters are expensive. Tap water will also work.\n4. As your say, once filters get clogged, fan has to work harder. With water, the pressure required from the fan will be almost constant, not dependent on how long ago water was changed. And water will be changed much more often, maybe daily, because it is cheaper.\n5. HEPA filters will be dumped in landfills, causing more pollution. Water can just be thrown down the drain, or even in flower pots. The extra dust and gases in this water is not extra pollution, it would have reached the soil system anyway."

    "title": "Art is Dead in This Country – And AI is Just the Final Nail",
    "content": "You know what’s worse than a country that doesn’t respect its artists?  \nA country that actively replaces them with filters, fakes, and fast content and claps for it.\n\nRecently, you might’ve seen the viral Ghibli-style AI trend. Feeds flooded with “Ghibli-fied” versions of people’s selfies. And what’s worse? Indians are leading the consumption of this trash. Even Sam Altman literally said he’s thrilled by how India is using AI so much. I saw this on instagram so I am sure if that was clickbait or not, we’re earning the title of **the largest consumers of AI**. And it's not because we’re doing groundbreaking research or building futuristic tech.\n\nBut because we have so little care for our artistic professionals and want everything they can do for cheap without paying money.\n\nLet me name names. There is a dude who held a MUSEUM in Mumbai recently, **Pranav Satbhai** dude’s not an artist, he’s a glorified picsart guy. He’s claims and has certificates claiming over **1500 “artworks”,** but he’s literally making bank by putting PicsArt filters on images and putting a background. Why do I have beef with him? I know a hundred artist personally, working regularly on their craft, drawing, painting, learning digitally, trying to get employed or freelance work, but someone like him doing absolutely nothing, makes work within 15 min, gets in popular news channels, he has been visited and praised by every marathi celebrity and politician and regularly getting commissions.\n\nPeople on the internet keep saying that “AI is a tool” or “It helps make art accessible.” But let me ask you:  \n**Accessible to whom?**\n\nTo the tech bros who don’t want to pay actual artists? To the producers who want 60% of the cost gone? To platforms that need content churned out every second like for Instagram lottery machine?\n\nYou’re not making art accessible you’re **erasing** it. You’re rewarding soulless imitations over original work. And people love it, because we’ve built a system where art is not meant to move or challenge you anymore just entertain you for 15 seconds before you scroll again.\n\nWe already see the consequences. People say “movies don’t hit like they used to” or “songs feel shallow.” That’s not just nostalgia. There were artists, poets, thinkers who ussed to make these works but they are removed from the equation because \"they think too much\" \"they take too much time\" \"they need more money\". I swear to god I have seen movies recently which were literally written with AI but they never admitted it. Something like Teri Baaton Me Uljha Jiyan, every scene was just AI with improv done in between, and producers *love* that. Cheap. Quick. Passable.\n\nMeanwhile, real writers, actors, and musicians across the world are on strike. SAG-AFTRA literally shut down Hollywood. People are protesting AI scans of actors, scriptwriting bots, and deepfake voice theft.\n\nIn India? Our digital laws are so weak, **anyone** can generate AI “art” and call it their own. We already don’t fund our artists. Now, instead of nurturing animators or illustrators, we’re importing “Make AI in India” initiatives that will destroy whatever little originality we had left.\n\nThe page Andheri West Shitposting kept saying recently that AI is actually the future, it is inevitable and then when the comments kept saying that you need to consider your views, they started attacking anime fans saying they felt bad that papa ghibli is angry. The problem isn't that ghibli was attacked, not one soul thought of commissioning an artist, every social media churner rushed to make the ai slop.\n\nAnd almost all countries have something to show off as their own in terms of animation, even Pakistan made an entire film inspired by Ghibli, but we have not even produced something close to the likes of ShinChan. Anime isn’t just a genre, it’s a *philosophy* of storytelling. Shows like *Attack on Titan*, *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, and *Cowboy Bebop* explore war, depression, and existentialism with depth and nuance. Even children’s anime like *Doraemon* or *Shin-chan* have thoughtful writing that respects its audience.\n\nCompare that to Indian animation, which is either mindless kids' content or cheaply made corporate slop. And with the AI stuff, we are making much more of this, youtubers and content creators already have made lots of these. I saw an entire AI Generated 3d film on hotstar too.\n\nThe biggest tragedy isn’t just that AI is stealing from artists—it’s that it’s killing the *desire* to create. Why would a child pick up a pencil when they can type \"Ghibli-style portrait\" into an AI generator? Why would anyone learn music when an algorithm can mimic Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi in seconds?\n\nWe’re raising a generation addicted to instant, disposable content. Kids today are overstimulated by flashy, AI-generated garbage, destroying their attention spans and creative instincts.\n\n**This isn’t progress. This is cultural rot. This is creative suicide.**  \nA country that doesn’t respect its artists doesn’t deserve to make art.  \nAnd India? We’ve stopped making art.  \nWe just generate it now.",

    "content": "\n\nBUYERS BEWARE!\n\nShriram LG \"Best Shop\" @ Navalur will sell you a product with manufacturing defect and will refuse to replace it even if it's just a month old. Their service team are incompetent, and do not know how to diagnose an issue with their own product. What you will be offered when you eventually figure out that you have been sold a defective item is that; a \"service engineer\" will be dispatched, who will take one look at it, upon which the higher beings bless the service engineer with a vague idea of what the problem might be, and without doing so much as opening up the unit, they will say \"ah, sir/madam, main board issue. We will order part and call you. Oh the product displays an issue with the internal fans? We don't care, you will take the main board replacement and be happy with it\".\n\nGod forbid if one makes the mistake of purchasing an essential home appliance like a refrigerator like me, then only the gods can help you. It has been over 20 days of back and forth with the customer reps over at the service center. 20 days with a 110kg paper weight that does not do its one job; cool things i keep in it. First it was defrost error, with an ungodly amount of ice building up. Then it was heater error, then it was frost fan error. We kicked up enough fuss to have a pretty experienced and polite service technician come over, and even he could not diagnose the issue. He took the time to test everything out. No shorts, nothing. \"all working as intended, i don't know what the issue is\". So rationally, if the service techs can't diagnose the issue, shouldn't the unit be replaced? Nah, that would make it too easy for the customer, so what's the solution you ask? \"Main board replacement\" What does that have to do with the internal fans shorting out? Fuck if I know.\n\nYou will also face very rude service center representatives, who, after my experience with them, should never interact with a customer ever again. You will be sent on a wild goose chase. I would add the \"Crime\" flair, considering how they rob their customers, can't add more flairs.\n\nI wouldn't be buying from LG if I was you. Sooner or later you will face the hell that is their customer service, and you will regret every choice in your life that led up to you making this purchase.\n\nUpdate: They replaced it.

      "This is terrible experience. You definitely need to register a complaint with the consumer court. You can do it online now. I have only used LG window AC once it ran for 12 years with no issues. But in your case they definitely need to replace it.",
      "I bought an LG split AC Flipkart last summer, and within just a couple of hours after installation, it started leaking gas from the top of the indoor unit with a loud hissing sound. The entire room was filled with gas, which felt really unsafe. The installation was done by the service team arranged through the retailer, and when I contacted them, they admitted it was likely a defective unit and told me to raise a replacement request.\n\nAs flipkart didn’t allow returns or replacements for this product, so I raised a service request directly with LG. But the local service center refused to help, saying they didn’t do the installation and couldn’t investigate. It was super frustrating dealing with both sides, especially with no one taking proper responsibility for such a serious issue.\n\nI had to suffer for an entire month without AC last summer. LG products and especially their service has been pathetic recently. Very disappointing.",
      "I have 2 LG AC's , 1 i got from CROMA , which is absolutely solid , 1 I got from Saravana stores which is not upto the mark in cooling i feel something is wrong with the unit. So i think it also comes down to where you are buying from sometimes. LG service cost is high but the UNITS itself without any defect work flawlessly. All the Godrej AC's i have  are having problems.",
      "Exactly... My experience is different but more or less they don't assist you... \n\n\nIn fact... I got the 400L refrigerator... This one does not require a stand... We were aneurysm about the stand because we don't know and the so called service engineer had come and set up a stand... After setting up fridge is now slant position inclined from front to back... So called service engineer says that it's the feature of fridge that the water will go back to house with the slant position... What the heck... We told we don't want the stand but he refused to take it because it's altered... Later we realized that a grudge of 400L does not require a stand. The stand is useless lying at my home without using once at a cost of 2500/- I went multiple times to the shop... There will be drama between sales guy and service engineer... And done... No outcome... It's been 7 months like this... \n\nI don't suggest this show room is pathetic",
      "With respect to dealership, try to buy from Tata Croma (I have always had a good experience when buying from them)\n\nWith respect to service, my understanding was LG has better service than other providers\n\nSeems like a defective unit in your case which is just bad luck\n\nTry to escalate and get it replaced",
      "Go to consumer court.",
      "As long as you don't interact with the service personnel, you're good. But at some point, if you ever run into a situation where you have to rely on the service engineers, I guarantee you'll regret choosing this brand.",
      "Both of them. LG service won't replace the unit but suggest replacing the main board (which 2 separate engineers confirmed it was working as intended). The dealership blames the service center for not cooperating to replace the unit"

Could the old fridge or geyser be major culprits? Or maybe the fans?\n\nHas anyone in a similar setup managed to reduce their summer bills? \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "I guess the AC and the geyser are consuming the most power. You should check the power consumption or rating of each one and then try to calculate. If you do not have the details written on the product, then you can get a smart plug or a power meter to check how much electricity is consumed over 24 hours by each of the AC, geyser, washing machine and fridge.",

      "BLDC fans are great as they almost reduce power consumption by half compared to the regular fan.\n\nFor other electronic appliances especially ACs consider upgrading to a 5-star rated model next time, as they are proven to be more energy-efficient.\n\nReplace the geyser with a solar-powered one in your next upgrade.\n\nAlso, check out the **PM Surya Ghar Yojana**.

      "got the atomberg ones all over the house. theyre great. and the remote thing is not much of a hassle as they are universal. but when installing them make sure the electrician bypasses the regulator or you will notice that the fans speed starts fluctuating with the voltage. another point, the customer service up till now is great. my favourite feature is you can set a timer to switch on or off. so i have the AC set to turn off 3 hours into the night and fan switches on 3 hours into the night. pretty neat",

We have only been using those for about four years and only one Atomberg fan has given up on us due to an electricity fluctuation. The support for Atomberg was very robust in my area. We have not faced any other problems with the fans. Generally speaking, Atomberg and Crompton both have very good customer support.\n\n\nI would 100% suggest you to switch to  BLDC fans. They are much more efficient and awesome.\n\n\nShoot a question if you want to know anything else.",

It’s time people changed their mindset and started admiring the right individuals—not just the famous ones.\n\nThe second thing is civic sense, which is almost zero here. People only seem to care about themselves. I saw a video where people were literally bypassing the metro gates just to stand close to a cricketer and take a selfie, hoping to gain some fame out of it. It’s ridiculous. What does that say about our priorities? India needs serious awareness about both civic sense and who we choose to admire.\n\nVirat Kohli — the person so many people worship — might not even choose to live in India anymore. Why? Because of the same ridiculous behavior people show while idolizing him. While it’s easy to blame public figures, the real problem lies within us. We are the ones fueling this obsession. We are the ones lacking civic sense. And ultimately, we are responsible for the environment we’ve created."

Overall reviews seem good on amazon but the recent ones are very negative. It seems hit or miss tbh. People are complaining about problems with BLDC motors like PCB getting burnt in a short time while some people are using it for years with no issue. The electricity saving also seems like a gimmick, its merely 1-2k rs per year. And you are losing out on basic things like regulator!\n\n\nThere are so many models for each brand even Crompton, Havells, etc, its so hard to choose one.\n\nHow are you guys beating the heat?

    "title": "My Indian Smart Home Journey with Home Assistant Green",
    "content": "Hey Folks,  \nSo I jumped into the Home Assistant world a few months back. Been seeing all the cool stuff people do globally, but didn't find a ton of specific info for setting things up here in India. Ordered the HA Green box from Seeed Studio – cost about $100 plus shipping and actually got here pretty fast, maybe 10 days. Setup was easy enough.  \n  \nBut then came the real challenge: getting my actual smart devices connected. Found out pretty quick that a lot of the stuff easily available on Amazon India or local stores doesn't have straightforward Home Assistant support, not even in HACS sometimes. Took a fair bit of digging, but I managed to get most things working one way or another. Thought I'd share what worked for me, in case it helps anyone else navigating this.  \n  \nA big part of the puzzle turned out to be the **Tuya integration**. Lots of Indian brands like Wipro seem to use Tuya on the backend, even if you use their own app like Smart Life. So, for my **Wipro smart plugs** (the 6A ones for lamps and the 16A for geysers), I paired them with the *Smart Life app* first. Then, in Home Assistant, I added the official Tuya integration and logged in using my *Smart Life* account details. Works great for turning things on/off.  \n  \nThis Tuya trick also helped with my **Atomberg fan**. The direct Atomberg integration wasn't playing nice for me, but I control the fan speed using an **Aziot smart regulator**. Since that regulator uses Tuya, I just added it to Smart Life, and boom, it showed up in HA via the same Tuya integration. I even control some old, non-smart LED strips just by plugging them into these Wipro smart plugs.  \n  \nThankfully, some things were simpler. My **Philips Wiz** bulbs connected fine using the standard Wiz integration in HA after setting them up in their app. My **LG TV** was also easy – the LG webOS integration found it on the network, I just had to confirm on the TV. And my **TP-Link Archer router** connected through its official integration.  \n  \nFor appliances without any wifi, like my main **O General AC**, the **Broadlink IR blaster** (I have an RM4 Mini) was essential. Added the Broadlink to HA, then used the service call to 'learn' the codes from my AC remote. Now HA can control it perfectly. For the bedroom **Voltas and Daikin ACs**, we don't mess with settings much, so I just put them on Wipro 16A plugs (again, Smart Life -> Tuya -> HA) for simple on/off control based on schedules – they just resume their last state.  \n  \nXiaomi/MI stuff needed a bit more work. For my **MI Air Purifier** and **MI CCTV cameras**, the standard integrations didn't cut it. I had to install **HACS** (Home Assistant Community Store – definitely get this if you haven't!) and then find the **Xiaomi Miot Auto** integration. This connects to the Xiaomi cloud and picked up both the purifier and cameras, letting me control them and see the camera feed on my dashboard. For my **MI bedside lamps**, I found the easiest way was using the **HomeKit Controller** integration built into HA. I just made sure the lamps were enabled for HomeKit in the Mi Home app, and HA discovered them directly.  \n  \nA couple of other random bits: my **Godrej Aer perfume** thingy connected via Bluetooth (just needed a cheap USB Bluetooth dongle for the HA Green) - still not figured out a seamless method to connect. And for my **VU TV**, which has no HA support, I use the **Google Cast** integration. HA sees the TV's built-in Chromecast, so I can at least cast stuff to it or control basic playback in automations.  \n  \nNow, a couple of warnings: I could **not** find any way to reliably integrate **Qubo smart switches** or my **Marshal Stanmore II** speaker. If HA control matters, maybe steer clear of those.  \n  \nGetting devices connected is only half the battle, right? The real fun is automating! I mounted an old **Lenovo Tab M8** on the wall, permanently powered, running the HA app full screen. It’s our main control panel. I've set up scenes like \"Good Morning\" (lights fade on, geyser starts), \"Evening,\" \"Movie Time,\" etc. I exposed these scenes to **Alexa** (using Nabu Casa), so now we just use voice commands. Got automations for practical stuff too – turning the mosquito repellent plugs on/off on a schedule, geysers based on time, and outdoor lights based on sunset/sunrise. Also got Music Assistant working with Spotify, so Alexa can play music through HA now.  \n  \nFor remote access and the easy Alexa link, I subscribed to **Nabu Casa**. It's about $7 a month, totally worth it to avoid fiddling with router settings. I even pointed a custom domain name I own to it.  \nThe best part? My wife, who isn't into tech stuff usually, actually loves it. Things just happen automatically, the house lighting feels way better, and we use voice commands for stuff constantly. It just makes daily routines smoother.  \n  \nStill got plans – want to add a **Yale smart lock** soon and maybe an **LG soundbar** (hoping that connects via the webOS integration like the TV).  \n  \nAnyway, that's my experience so far setting up Home Assistant here in India. It definitely took some figuring out, but it's totally possible and really rewarding once it clicks.  \n  \nWould love to hear from other HA users in India!",

      "A zigbee hub can't run Wifi devices, but a majority of Zigbee devices can be controlled directly from a good Coordinator connected to Home Assistant (HA).\n\nTo check you can look them up on [Zigbee2MQTT Supported Devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/). But the SmartThings and Hue should work fine.\n\nThere are [Integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/) in HA for a lot of cloud services such as Google Home & Tuya. Both LG and Eufy have a couple of different integrations, you would have to check your specific devices.\n\nPutting everything through Tuya is unlikely to work, and is not recommended if it did.   Zigbee2MQTT has 4000 devices it can control, with more being added each month.  Tuya will work with its own devices but only a small amount of other companies products.\n\nThe main reason for going direct with Zigbee, however, is having devices controlled directly at home. Without any need for cloud operations.\n\nRegarding \"Works with Google\" - if a device is set up in HA then you should be able to expose it to Google, as long as Google recognizes that type of device.",
      "I don’t think you’ve gotten yourself into a “situation.” I think you are in the situation most of find us in when we get into Home Assistant.\n\nDon’t worry about the number of WiFi devices you have. I have over 120 Tuya devices on my network. All of your zigbee devices could be consolidated to a zigbee coordinator in Home Assistant. I wouldn’t try to move things to a Tuya zigbee Hub. Your SmartThings hub is a better coordinator and more compatible than any of the Tuya ones that I have seen. And the SmartThings hub is a viable option until you decide to migrate everything to Home Assistant.\n\nSadly Home Assistant still has a learning curve and requires some tinkering. However there are plenty of YouTube videos to get you started.\n\nEverything on your list should work with Home Assistant. However I have not had good experiences with the Eufy camera and home base integration.",

      "I’ve had Nest for years and Ecobee for years and I believe the Ecobee is a better experience. Overall, they’re all kind of the same. The “smart” auto change features never really hit the mark and at least for me I end up doing a manual schedule and basically leaving it alone. I do like that I can connect Ecobee to HomeKit so if you have iOS devices you can use Siri to change the temp.",
      "The new thermostat you get will have this plate where the wires connect.  So you don't have to worry about finding one compatible with this place.\n\nSo really any smart thermostat will work.  If anything you MAY need to check the wire configuration on the board at the Air Handler, especially since I see a Blue wire where a Yellow would normally go.\n\nThat said, Ecobee and Nest are the usual go-tos for most, but there are Honeywell smart options as well.",

I have these to track basement temps and second floor temps off the house thermostat.",
      "I have the two Honeywell t9 w/sensor. Duke Energy had them on sale. Before I had the cheaper Honeywell and they worked fine for 5 years but I moved. Both you could control with your phone local and remote. The T9 has plenty of options.\n\nI don't care much for the \"learning\" hype on thermostats because I'm retired. If you have a steady schedule that might be something you should look for.",
      "The lack of a C wire is potentially a problem. It's possible you have an unused fifth wire in the wall that can be connected to a C terminal at the furnace. If you do, then anything should work. Without, Nest should still work, but may have issues.  \n\n Ecobee has a power kit, included with some models and optional with others, that allows you to use the four wires you have. Check their compatibility test here: [https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/compatibility/thermostat/](https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/compatibility/thermostat/)",

      "I'll put a big vote in for ecobee.\n\nI replaced my 3 Honeywells with them. Upstairs, I have remote sensors in each guest bedroom, where the thermostat itself is in a common area.\n\nI did need an ecobee rep to help with the installation.  She stayed on the phone with me for the entire duration. -First rate service!\n\nI think their app is great. It has so many capabilities.  I also have it integrated with my Hubitat Elevation hub and Alexa.",
      "I installed a smart thermostat myself, so I’ve gotten a bit familiar with thermostat wiring. From your pic, I don’t see a c-wire, which most smart thermostats need, but sometimes it’s tucked behind, so it’s worth checking inside the wall plate jic.\nEven if you don’t have it, you can still go for a smart thermostat using a c wire adapter. I went with the smart thermostat eco from cielo because i was already using their controllers for minisplits. It came with the c-wire adapter in the box,  no extra cost. I used that during installation and it all went pretty smoothly.\nAlso, the Cielo mobile app is super user-friendly. If you’re on fence, I’d definitely recommend looking into it.",

With the T9 thermostat connected to the older second router, what's interesting is that if I click the gear icon in the resideo app and rename the thermostat, within 1 second the thermostat on the wall shows the changed name from the phone app. So they must be talking to one another. And yet the resideo app on the phone only says \"syncing with thermostat\" still after hours - no temperature or ability to change temperature from the app. But I can change the thermostat's name from the app and the thermostat shows the changed name nearly instantly on the thermostat's display. Really stumped.",
      "Hi. I’m having this same issue. Did you ever figure it out?",

I wonder what it is doing?",
      "Sorry, I didn't see your reply until now. \n\nI finally got after I allowed it to sit connected to wifi for approximately 5 days. Then finally after days of trying, it synced with the Resideo app. I have no idea why it takes so incredibly long to sync with the Resideo app, although it updated its firmware version number. If a firmware update was required for it to sync with the app, I really wish Resideo/Honeywell Home had an option to force the firmware update \"now\" and/or a status message to show that it's updating the firmware.\n\nAlso it dropped offline, and I couldn't get it to reconnect. I created another \"home\" with a name other than \"home\" and added the second Honeywell thermostat to that and then it would re-add to the Resideo app. Very strange, and frustrating, but so far so good now after days of working on it.\n\nHope you got yours to connect and sync as well now.",
      "I finally got it synced. Despite the thermostat cannot sync with the Resideo, I added the thermostat to HomeKit with my phone. The setup was automatic and takes a few minutes. When set up, in the Home app, go to the thermostat, click on the gear icon on the lower right corner. A new page shows up, click on Bridge, and open Resideo from the page that follows. Now go back to Resideo, and voila, it is now synced.",
      "I finally got it by waiting approximately 5 days for it to sync with the Resideo app.\n\nI don't understand why the Resideo app takes so incredibly long to sync with the Honeywell Home thermostat. Looking at my wifi router, it is transferring in bits per second, not kb, but bits per second. While the wifi connection is fast right next to the thermostat. \n\nI finally got it by allowing it to sync with the Resideo app for approximately 5 days. It says it may take a \"few minutes\" so... \n\nThen before I went to take a trip where I wanted to control the thermostat remotely, the night before leaving in the morning I got an alert that my Honeywell Home thermostat was offline. After a couple hours it was still offline, so I removed it and tried to re-add it. It wouldn't sync. I then created another home name (not \"home\" for this second thermostat) and then it added.\n\nI still get a few alerts that my Resideo app is having difficulty connecting to my Honeywell Home thermostat, but so far so good (knocking on wood)\n\nI think Honewell Home really needs to improve the Resideo app. It needs to sync within minutes, not days. And it really needs some debug messages instead of spinning for hours on end.\n\n  \nIt might be that when you first get the thermostat it is doing firmware updates too. Again, it really really needs some better logging and debug messages to let the user know what is going on. Just sitting there spinning is not good at all.",
      "Interesting. I'm not sure on \"why\" this works, but really useful tip. Thanks for sharing this. And glad you got yours connected. I found this experience extremely frustrating, but when it's working, it's nice. I hope it stays working, both for you and me :)",

I was cursing my bond controller, but I think the issue is buying the cheapest fan speed controller and remote on Amazon.\n\nI had to troubleshoot for about 45 minutes because I couldn't get the remote to pair with my Bond bridge. It said 433 MHz, but after pairing, the Bond bridge would send the signal, and nothing would happen.\n\nThe kit claims to use 433 MHz, which is FCC compliant.  And it does send a signal at 433 MHz. But it also sends RF at 863 MHz with the actual signal, which my bridge can't pick up because it's FCC compliant. I confirmed this with a spectrum analyzer.\n\nSo, if anyone has had trouble pairing certain RF remotes with a Bond bridge, this may be a common trick companies use to comply with FCC regulations and sell here. Just a theory.\n\nLong story short, I have to go to Lowe's and buy a better fan controller.  Boo.\n",

It's possible though, however, all I can say is that the bond bridge would record the signal at 433 MHz and then when sending the signal back out the fan would not respond. It seems more likely that the fan receiver is only picking up the signal at 863 Mhz.\n\nI later picked up another fan controller from Lowes. This controller sent our rf at 305 MHz and had no secondary response on the spectrum analyzer. I tested it the same way as the prior one. The Bond bridge worked well with the new controller."

    "content": "We are selling our current home and I have time while our new house is being built to consider how best to replicate what I had and could do in the old house, but it begs the question, do I go with what I had and know, or switch to something that might be better?  So I'm looking for opinions. \n\nI guess I'm thinking more about what to go with for the light/ceiling fan switches, and alarm. \n\nIn the old house I added TP-Link Kasa smart switches and plug in modules in all but a few rooms, mesh wifi (Asus AiMesh with RT-BE88U host, and TUF-AZ5400 and RT-AX88u as nodes), Eufy Cam Pro cameras (inside and outside) with Homebase 1?, Eufy Door Lock (T8520), Eufy door bell cam (T8221),  Echo dots/shows, Honeywell Smart Color thermostats, Liftmaster myQ Garage doors and ADT alarm.    \n\nIt worked well, I could voice control all the lights and ceiling fans,  the door bell chimed across every echo (so we could hear it anywhere in the house),  I was notified of motion on the driveway, front porch, and pool plus it was recorded locally (no subscriptions), I could lock/unlock the door by voice or remotely, open/close the garages remotely, etc.  \n\nThe new house is a townhouse, much smaller foot print (2096 sq ft), and has less light switches, doors, and first floor windows.    \n\nThe router/mesh isn't hard mounted to the house, so I'll likely take that with me and re-use.  Same with the Echo shows/dots and Eufy equipment.   From their models, they are using Genie brand garage door openers, so I'll likely look at their Aladdin Connect device/app.\n\nThe biggest uses is voice control of lights/fans, making sure the lights are off and doors are locked at night without having to run around the house or up/down stairs, hearing the doorbell chime everywhere in the house, seeing/interacting when someone comes to the door,  watching the driveway, being able to get in if I forgot my key, adjusting the thermostat from my phone and such.  \n\nThe ADT alarm monitoring became really expensive over time.  We never had an issue where it was needed.  I mean no break in attempts, fires, etc.   But having the piece of mind while we were away on vacation, etc. was nice.   IF there are better (or just as good/reputable) options for less, I'd be interested as I don't want to pay as much as ADT charges for their equipment and monitoring/monthly fee.  \n\nThe Kasa switches fit my budget and were easy to install, setup, and just worked.  IP addresses being taken up were an issue at first (I'm in IT so lots of computers, tablets, phones, streaming devices, etc. needing IP addresses on my home network), but being able to setup a separate IoT network solved that.  I've seen the new switches support Matter,  which some/most of my echo devices act as Matter hubs? Is there any benefit to that? or is  wifi good enough?   Is there a \"budget friendly\" option better than Kasa? \n\n\n\n",

      "You have a two wire system with a battery operated thermostat, you will need the Nest power adapter.\n\nThat being said there are some rumblings that those boilers have issues providing power to smart thermostats, but IDK if that's a real issue or old men yelling at clouds  \n[https://hvac-talk.com/vbb/threads/2278205-Google-Nest-Power-Connector-issues-with-Buderus-Riello-Burner](https://hvac-talk.com/vbb/threads/2278205-Google-Nest-Power-Connector-issues-with-Buderus-Riello-Burner)",
      "Th Nest should say what the wires and power recommendation is needed.\n\nI recently got a Ecobee, my current thermostat is a 2 wire, and I need 18/5 awg (18 gauge, 5 wire) to run my Ecobee.\n\nI need to order the wire before I can install it.\n\nTake the red cover box off and see where the 2 wires go to on the control board and see how many wires it can hold.",
      "Huh... Thanks for the link... Yeah I'll have to have a look at my board... Thing is though I am getting 27V at the two wires currently going to the thermostat, so my furnace to at least some degree does put out a low voltage wire that could hopefully get used to keep the nest powered on and charged...",
      "Even with the 27V across the two wires? I thought the nest could use that for power as well as comms to turn the furnace on/off?\n\nDoes the nest power adapter change the power to those two wires? Or does it add a new wire? Cause that would be a pain in the ass...\n\nEver heard of a nest burning out a furnace control board?",
      "The two wires from the upstairs thermostat go into a little silver box with a reset button. I opened that up (I forget exactly what was in there but it wasn't helpful, but I can take a pic).\n\nFrom there a shielded brown wire containing at least the two thermostat wires goes to a panel on the main furnace...\n\nIs that where the control board will be? And it should be labelled with letters, have connectors, and presumably at least two wires tied to it, with spots for more?\n\nAnd I guess I'm looking for an empty spot with 'C' so I can run a common wire up with the existing wires, making it a three wire system (two existing for on/off and a common for power for the thermostat?)",
      "How would the Nest use the power wires as comms from that end without modifications, or more accurately how are you imagining that the furnace would understand what ever signal magic that is? Not trying to be a jerk, but just walk me through your logic on that one.",
      "Well, I obviously don't know about this which is why I'm asking for help... As far as wiring, etc., I'm more familiar with 12 DC automotive systems...\n\nThings we don't understand can absolutely look like magic, and we can expect magic from them... I guess in my mind I was hoping the thermostat could keep powered by letting enough power through to be on and charge the battery, but not enough and/or not send a signal back through to the furnace unless it wants the furnace on.\n\nBut yeah, I am just kinda guessing, there's a lot I don't know. I don't know if at the furnace all that's happening is the control board is receiving an ON/OFF signal from the two wires going to the thermostat in the form of 0V=off and 27V=on, or if the thermostat sends data/digital signal to turn on, or if the thermostat regulates the 27V and send an on/off signal if like 10V...\n\nSo there's me walking you through my uninformed \"logic\" on that one, which wasn't really thought out and probably looks stupid to anyone that actually knows what's going on. But hey, at least you're not being a jerk...",
      "What about with a ground wire added? Or I guess neutral for AC? Could the thermostat then not have the 27V 'hot' wire power/charge the unit from the 27V wire to thermostat to neutral...\n\nThen when the thermostat wants to turn the furnace on, it could send power through the existing wires?"

    "title": "My Indian Smart Home Journey with Home Assistant Green",
    "content": "Hey Folks,  \nSo I jumped into the Home Assistant world a few months back. Been seeing all the cool stuff people do globally, but didn't find a ton of specific info for setting things up here in India. Ordered the HA Green box from Seeed Studio – cost about $100 plus shipping and actually got here pretty fast, maybe 10 days. Setup was easy enough.  \n  \nBut then came the real challenge: getting my actual smart devices connected. Found out pretty quick that a lot of the stuff easily available on Amazon India or local stores doesn't have straightforward Home Assistant support, not even in HACS sometimes. Took a fair bit of digging, but I managed to get most things working one way or another. Thought I'd share what worked for me, in case it helps anyone else navigating this.  \n  \nA big part of the puzzle turned out to be the **Tuya integration**. Lots of Indian brands like Wipro seem to use Tuya on the backend, even if you use their own app like Smart Life. So, for my **Wipro smart plugs** (the 6A ones for lamps and the 16A for geysers), I paired them with the *Smart Life app* first. Then, in Home Assistant, I added the official Tuya integration and logged in using my *Smart Life* account details. Works great for turning things on/off.  \n  \nThis Tuya trick also helped with my **Atomberg fan**. The direct Atomberg integration wasn't playing nice for me, but I control the fan speed using an **Aziot smart regulator**. Since that regulator uses Tuya, I just added it to Smart Life, and boom, it showed up in HA via the same Tuya integration. I even control some old, non-smart LED strips just by plugging them into these Wipro smart plugs.  \n  \nThankfully, some things were simpler. My **Philips Wiz** bulbs connected fine using the standard Wiz integration in HA after setting them up in their app. My **LG TV** was also easy – the LG webOS integration found it on the network, I just had to confirm on the TV. And my **TP-Link Archer router** connected through its official integration.  \n  \nFor appliances without any wifi, like my main **O General AC**, the **Broadlink IR blaster** (I have an RM4 Mini) was essential. Added the Broadlink to HA, then used the service call to 'learn' the codes from my AC remote. Now HA can control it perfectly. For the bedroom **Voltas and Daikin ACs**, we don't mess with settings much, so I just put them on Wipro 16A plugs (again, Smart Life -> Tuya -> HA) for simple on/off control based on schedules – they just resume their last state.  \n  \nXiaomi/MI stuff needed a bit more work. For my **MI Air Purifier** and **MI CCTV cameras**, the standard integrations didn't cut it. I had to install **HACS** (Home Assistant Community Store – definitely get this if you haven't!) and then find the **Xiaomi Miot Auto** integration. This connects to the Xiaomi cloud and picked up both the purifier and cameras, letting me control them and see the camera feed on my dashboard. For my **MI bedside lamps**, I found the easiest way was using the **HomeKit Controller** integration built into HA. I just made sure the lamps were enabled for HomeKit in the Mi Home app, and HA discovered them directly.  \n  \nA couple of other random bits: my **Godrej Aer perfume** thingy connected via Bluetooth (just needed a cheap USB Bluetooth dongle for the HA Green) - still not figured out a seamless method to connect. And for my **VU TV**, which has no HA support, I use the **Google Cast** integration. HA sees the TV's built-in Chromecast, so I can at least cast stuff to it or control basic playback in automations.  \n  \nNow, a couple of warnings: I could **not** find any way to reliably integrate **Qubo smart switches** or my **Marshal Stanmore II** speaker. If HA control matters, maybe steer clear of those.  \n  \nGetting devices connected is only half the battle, right? The real fun is automating! I mounted an old **Lenovo Tab M8** on the wall, permanently powered, running the HA app full screen. It’s our main control panel. I've set up scenes like \"Good Morning\" (lights fade on, geyser starts), \"Evening,\" \"Movie Time,\" etc. I exposed these scenes to **Alexa** (using Nabu Casa), so now we just use voice commands. Got automations for practical stuff too – turning the mosquito repellent plugs on/off on a schedule, geysers based on time, and outdoor lights based on sunset/sunrise. Also got Music Assistant working with Spotify, so Alexa can play music through HA now.  \n  \nFor remote access and the easy Alexa link, I subscribed to **Nabu Casa**. It's about $7 a month, totally worth it to avoid fiddling with router settings. I even pointed a custom domain name I own to it.  \nThe best part? My wife, who isn't into tech stuff usually, actually loves it. Things just happen automatically, the house lighting feels way better, and we use voice commands for stuff constantly. It just makes daily routines smoother.  \n  \nStill got plans – want to add a **Yale smart lock** soon and maybe an **LG soundbar** (hoping that connects via the webOS integration like the TV).  \n  \nAnyway, that's my experience so far setting up Home Assistant here in India. It definitely took some figuring out, but it's totally possible and really rewarding once it clicks.  \n  \nWould love to hear from other HA users in India!",

    "title": "Experience of migrating from Home Assistant to Homey",
    "content": "I have been running HA for about 2-3 years now. Running a Zigbee network with a single zwave thermostat bridged via SmartThings.\nAbout 110 devices- about 50% Aqara, 40% ikea and a smattering of others (sunricher, hue, etc). A few local wifi implementations (Philips air cleaners) and a few cloud implementations (Daikin air conditioners, Ebeco thermostats, a few tuya devices).\n\nI’m not an expert, but know enough to understand the complexity of HA. Have had to do some weird things with HA, such as running two additional Z2M gateways because Aqara doesn’t play will with others and one area of my house (extension behind walls that have foil in then) kept falling off the network. Before adding the extra Z2M gateways, was losing 1-2 devices per week.  After that losing 1 device every few months.\n\nBought a Homey Pro in late November and have been migrating the devices in batches. Am now about 95% complete. Here are my thoughts and experiences.\n\n1. With the exception of my Ikea trådfri blinds, Homey has been rock solid. After a hub reboot, the blinds need to have one off their physical buttons pressed once and everything works. It seems to be a strange bug, but it is known. Other than that, no devices have fallen off the network.\n2. Everything works. Some of the motion sensitive automations are a little slow sometimes - a few second delay, but they are reliable. Same thing with switches- sometimes it takes a second or two. Did not have these delays with HA.\n3. No visibility of network routing or strength. I understand that they homey 2019 hub supports this, but they removed this from 2023. A bit annoying, as this is helpful to determine why things work the way they do.\n4. Homey Apps work quite well. I did have a sunricher outlet strip that wasn’t fully supported and upon request, the app developer updated it and I was able to use it a few days later. Your results may vary.\n5. Use known good hardware. I have a ceiling fan using some old Tuya IR blaster using HA. Have totally forgotten how it works, so had a broadlink RM4 that I was going to use. Using the Broadlink IOS app, I could learn the remote control buttons. But using the broadlink integration for Homey, no joy. Would not acknowledge that I was pressing any buttons. Spend roughly 40 EUR and bought a switchbot, installed the switchbot app, and all is good.\n6. Flows are fantastic. Especially advanced flows. Everyone manages their flows differently, but I basically set up one advanced flow per room and keep all of the flows there. Stuff in HA that took 10-15 different rules (conditionals based upon time of day) and was a small nightmare to change is now   visually represented and takes all of 20 seconds to change.\n7. Spouse acceptance factor. I could not get my wife anywhere near home assistant. And things would invariably break when I was travelling. Within about 10 minutes, I had her recreating some of the more advanced HA flows in Homey. This is a big win in my books.\n8. Support community. The local community is knowledgable and spends the time to help people out. I have had a few questions during the migration and questions have been invariably answered in a few hours.\n\nThoughts about the migration…\n1. All of my ikea devices were updated to the latest firmware in HA before removing them.\n2. For my Aqara devices… remove from HA. Link to Aqara Hub. Update firmware. Remove from Aqara hub. Add to Homey\n3. Wired Aqara and sunricher devices are your friends. When they are removed, they immediately into pairing mode. This makes the migration so much easier.\n4. Ikea is not your friend. Every device needs to be manually put into pairing mode. This takes time. \n5. This is not a quick project, especially with firmware updates and 100+ devices. Plan on a few boring evenings and a weekend day or two.\n6. I worked room by room. A lot of my switches are not hardwired to devices, so we had about a week where half the house was controlled with Alexa (via Home Assistant) and half via the Homey App. \n7. Did not create flows until virtually the whole house was migrated. This allowed me to figure out naming schemes as I went and how they would work in the longer term with minimal refactoring. Only started with the flows after everything in a room was migrated.\n8. Cannot count the number of times that I made stupid mistakes … eg, turn off the light after the room has been _active_ (should have been inactive) for 5 minutes. So the hall light never turned off except when we were all in the hall putting out shoes on. Or selecting the wrong region. This is why you should space out things and not do it all at once. Easy enough to fix, but annoying until you figure it out.\n \n\nHomey shortcomings\n1. Inability to update firmware. Seriously. If HA can do it, why can’t Homey?\n2. I have some built in Ikea Leptiter spotlights, 3 in a row. The only way to put them in pairing mode is to hit the breaker, but Homey can only pair 1 Zigbee device at a time. By the time that the first one is paired, the two remaining have timed out, which means hitting the breaker six times… which means that the first one resets as well. I literally had to unscrew floor boards in the attic to put in physical switches for the these lights. \n3. Closed source. Yes. It is a weakness, but it is also a business model. I know LG has bought them and this is a concern - will this cause a subscription fee in the long term? But will also probably mean financial stability, so it is a two edged sword. Only time will tell.\n4. Homey support is slow. I emailed them a presales question a week before I bought it and got a response two weeks after I had bought it. For something that costs almost 500 EUR, this isn’t acceptable.\n5. Homey App documentation. Homey has the concept of apps that support various integrations or specific functions (eg dimming over time). However most of these are poorly documented and it can take a lot of testing to get things working. Each app has a link to a thread on the homey support forums These apps would definitely be enhanced by a link to some basic documentation that shows how they work. \n6. A legacy of the history of Homey… I guess it is a Dutch company and while the forums are almost all in English, a huge number of the screenshots are in Dutch. As a Swedish speaker, I can follow it somewhat, but it is very annoying, especially since Google translate doesn’t work on screenshots (easily). I get that people have their Homeys in the local language and the community is providing the help, but this is not a problem that I faced in HA. \n7. Advanced flows are really great, but they really need app support. You can only do these on a computer web browser and they are so powerful. Homey really needs to figure this out.\n\nOverall, so far, I am happy. I have been able to scale down from 3x Raspberry Pi and a SmartThings hub to a single Homey Pro. Power usage is also down. Homey has also added insights and dashboards in the past two weeks and I am starting to play with these as well - they look promising. It is great to be able to see at a glance how many lights I have on, what my total power consumption across all devices is, etc.  Also nice to get the random alert that something has upgraded and not have to cringe every time I press the update button wondering what is going to break.\n\nDoes it have the same super flexability that HA has? No, it doesn’t. I know that I can do some things in HA that I can’t do with Homey. Does it do everything that I want and need it to do? So far, yes. Does it have a better interface for handling automations? In my mind, absolutely. Is it worth the money? At this point, I would say a cautious yes (getting the wife to create a flow was probably alone worth the cost). But I also buy Macs, iPads and iPhones and a Prusa. I put value on the end results. Others may (rightfully) put the value on the flexability that HA has.\n\nHappy to answer any questions that you may have.  ",

      "Ironically I’ve been using Homey for a year and just starting to dabble in HA but am using Homey as a bridge so I have things in both. Wanted better dashboards. But I agree. I’ve had really NO drops with Homey. Coincidentally I noticed three Aqara water sensors were no longer showing an alert status so I am unsure if it was a result of linking to HA thru MQTT or if they had dropped a while ago. Logs weren’t clear. I was able to repair within Homey and bridge back to HA.",
      "I keep HA away from the wife, I present everything to Apple Home. She can work that interface without issue. \n\nEvery automation has a switch so she can enable disable in Apple Home.\n\nI use node red for automations, automations in HA suck.",

Apple TV is as big one as well that doesn’t have any official support which is really annoying imo. I have an Unfolded Circle Remote 3 arriving early next year (first 100 backers) and hopefully that can fill in some gaps for automating my shitty home theater. \n\nDo you have any mmWave devices?

Example: 'Hey Google, turn on the living room light'. The manager usually also allows pressing a button on your phone to remotely control the connected device without speaking.\n\nA conventional option is to add 'smart' devices (plugs, switches, and bulbs) to control lights, and then create a single command to operate all the lights without having to physically touch each switch: 'Hey Google, turn off all the lights'.",

    "content": "I will be totally honest here... I have no idea how thermostats work. So maybe this \"problem\" is totally normal, but I am freezing here so I'm going to ask anyway.\n\nI live in an apartment that has a Honeywell Home T6 Smart Thermostat. I haven't had any problems with the thermostat itself up until now, and it's always heated and cooled the way I've expected it to. I have it set on a schedule to heat to 70 at night, and heat to 74 during the day, and it has always done that (with maybe a few degree variation, but I'm talking heating to 72 instead of 74). Today I wake up, and my thermostat REFUSES to go past 65. I did see it go up to 66 a few times, but never past that. I run cold, so anything under 70 is FREEZING to me (I sometimes even increase it to 78), and it has been like this all day.\n\nI have tried turning the system off for a few minutes then turning the heat back on, I've tried using the emergency heat, I even turned the thermostat totally off, and after an hour it read the temperature was still 65, so clearly it's not heating if it didn't change. I only have a few doors and windows to the outside, and I've checked them all to make sure they're all closed.\n\nLooking on the app, it doesn't seem like anything is wrong. It says it's following schedule, and it says it's heating to 74, except it's not. It's also worth noting that I can't access the actual heating unit since again I live in an apartment, I'd have to call maintenance for that. Again, I really don't know much about the mechanics of these things, but generally my understanding of thermostats is it displays what temperature it is inside, then you can set it to a different temperature, and it will heat / cool to keep the room at around that temperature. I do hear the fan running, and when I turn it off I can hear the click, so I don't think it's broken or anything.\n\nI know this isn't a lot of info to go off of (since again, I can't access the actual unit). But I mainly just want to know, is something wrong and I should call maintenance? Or is it possible my building did something? Or is this normal and has to do with the outside temperature or something? Or is there something else I should do that can fix it? Thank you in advance :) <3\n\nEDIT:  \nAdding for context, but there are no alerts shown on the thermostat. It shows an alert / alert code for things like if the heat pump needs service, the air filters need replaced, loss of power, stuff like that. It doesn't say anything is wrong, so unless it's not detecting something, I'm not sure it's a maintenance issue, but again I really don't know. I have been wearing lots of clothes / blankets as well as having my space heater running, so I'm at least not suffering too much anymore!\n\nEDIT 2:\nMy heat is working again! It got a bit warmer (right now up to 32°, compared to 7° this morning) so I'm pretty sure it was just the cold. But thank u so much to everyone who offered help and advice! <3",

I'm able to program a schedule within the diffuser app however can't get precise enough fan controls with my Nest thermostat to run on an ideal schedule. (Nest only allows for specific time intervals per each hour and while I prefer only activating it in the morning hours + evening so it doesn't run when no one is home, the main issue is that it doesn't turn the fan on at an exact and specific time so that it mirrors the diffuser schedule; it's pretty inconsistent and I don't want the diffuser running when the fan is off. \n\n  \nGoogle has removed IFTTT integrations and Google Home, SmartThings, Apple Homekit and every other Nest compatible automation app does not allow for more specific scheduling. \n\n  \nTLDR: \n\n* Need a solution to run very specific On/Off schedules for my HVAC fan setting. \\*Not On/Auto. \n* Not opposed to replacing the Nest with an Ecobee or Honeywell if someone can confirm it allows for more specific scheduling, within UI or IFTTT / 3rd party automation app. I've read that certain thermostats limit fan enabling to only when heat / AC is operating. Need it to be independent. \n* Also not opposed to changing the diffuser schedule to essentially run at all times but powering it from a smart outlet that somehow gets triggered by my HVAC system / fan turning on. (Perhaps a vibration sensor / decibel sensor I can place on top of the system) \n\nSchedule Example: \n\n6:00am: Fan On \n\n6:05am: Fan Off \n\n6:30am: Fan On  \n\n6:35am: Fan Off\n\n7am - 5pm: Fan Off (no one home)\n\n5:30pm: Fan On \n\n5:35pm: Fan Off \n\netc. \n\n",

      "I recently did the same thing: diffuser in the HVAC. \n\nI ended up placing booster fans just before the diffuser in the duct so I didn't have to turn on the large HVAC fans, blow air through all the vents, and constantly be turning them on and off. \n\nWhat I have now are automations that turn the booster fans and diffusers on and off using smart plugs. I have the schedule in the diffuser set from 1:01am to 1:00am so it runs whenever the smart plug is on.  \n\nThe automations turn the plugs on in the morning and turn them off at night.  They also turn them off when we leave home and turn them on when we arrive. \n\n\nThe result of all of this is that we have total control over the schedule in HA, can't hear the fans, and save on oil because it doesn't run while we're out of the house during the day. \n\nThat all said, I can confirm that almost any thermostat gives you detailed control over on/off.  I have Honeywell thermostats that came with the house that I can control. I also used to have nest thermostats and remember being able to turn the fan on with HA, so maybe double check if that's possible with your existing nest. I liked the look of mine but also wanted more control, so I disabled most of the smart features. \n\nGood luck!",
      "This is actually perfect. I much rather rely on programable smart outlets considering I already have a dozen around my house running certain schedules. Not to mention, I work next door to an HVAC supplier and will have my hands on an in-line booster by the afternoon. \n\n  \nOut of curiosity, what is your approximate usage rate in ml for the oil? My diffuser has a 1000ml capacity and I'm planning on running it for 13 minutes per day (working diffuse time) How often do you need to get new oil?",
      "Which Honeywell thermostat do you have? I replaced a Nest with the Honeywell Zwave thermostat and I’ve yet to find a way to control just the AC fan via home automation. Works fine through the thermostat itself.",
      "I just got them about a week ago, so not sure on oil usage yet. \n13 minutes sounds very light. The schedule on my actual diffusers is 60s on, 120s off.  I have them set to do that 24 hours every day because I turn them off, along with the duct fan, via the smart plug when I don't want it to diffuse.\n\nSo mine are \"on\" about 9 hours each day, which means they are actively diffusing 1/3 of that time (one out of every three minutes), or about 3 hours of actual diffusing every day!",
      "Mine is the Honeywell 9000 wifi.\n\nIt's not pretty and I probably wouldn't have chose it, but they were already in the house and they work well, so no need to replace them.",
      "Do you have any issues with the diffuser schedule / settings resetting if the plug is turned off? What diffuser are you using? \n\n  \nI'd likely also want the diffuser and fan plugged into the same smart outlet so I have the peace of mind knowing they're working in sync.",
      "Ah, that explains it. The WiFi models are surprisingly more feature rich than the Zwave model.",
      "That's the first thing I checked: that the diffuser would remember the settings while it's off. Works great.

When I left that platform anything that was added custom through the ide went offline if you lost Internet. Was a real pita when I lost control of switches or such since ST didn't keep up well with the market of devices",
      "Custom drivers are now all Edge drivers (unlike the old cloud-based Groovy IDE that no longer exists). In my own experience, all of my custom Edge drivers support local control. That's because those drivers literally reside and execute on the hub itself and not in the cloud. Actually works really well. As painful as the transition was from the old platform to the new one, it was absolutely for the better. Anyone who says smartthings is awful because of an experience prior to the transition has no idea how well it works now."

After a few hours or so, an annoying scrolling message appears saying \"Register online for outdoor temperature\". I do not care about outdoor temperature. The only way to make this message go away is clicking a \"Done\" button, but then it just comes back a few hours later.\n\nI believe this may be fixable through the honeywell resideo app, however the previous tenant has connected their device to the thermostat so the app won't let me connect it to mine without removing the previous connected device. Obviously I don't know who the previous tenant was, so I can't just ask them to disconnect my thermostat from their app. I believe I can call Honeywell and they can disconnect it for me, but I'm not a fan of dealing with customer service if I don't have to. Again, I don't even care about the outside temperature, all I want is for the screen to stay on the temperature screen but there is literally no option to do that. I have tried putting on the screen lock and going through the settings, but the message still came up. \n\nWhen it IS on the temperature screen there is also a warning symbol at the top (a little triangle with an exclamation point inside). I don't know if that's related to this problem but I figured I'd mention it anyway just in case.\n\nSo, is there any way that I can fix this myself or do I *have* to contact Honeywell? Totally can if I need to, but I'd rather save myself a call or an email. Thanks in advance.",

    "content": "Does any company make a thermostat with these features:\n\n1. Set a schedule to run the furnace fan at night. e.g. 20 minutes every hour\n2. Accepts and uses temperature readings from a local, wired, outdoor temperature sensor\n3. Is actually good quality and works well\n\n\nI want to run the fan regularly at night to ensure we get good airflow and enough oxygen/low CO2 while sleeping.\nI want a local temperature sensor so the thermostat could control a heat pump + furnace dual fuel system. This way it could use the heat pump down to some set outdoor temperature, and then switch over to the \"backup\"/regular heat source below that temperature.\ne.g. \"Below 14 F / -10 C, stop using the heat pump\". So you don't suddenly skyrocket your power bill if it tries to use the heat pump when it is too cold outside (below the efficiency curve).\n\n\n\nI have searched through a number of subreddits, called half a dozen HVAC companies in my area, and researched and tried the following models. [Venn diagram image here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/8YCY65ZR1W#pJ9KfthDdlNx). These options do not work:\n\n**1) Ecobee - High quality but no local outdoor sensor**\n\nEcobee thermostats seem to work well. They have a nice UI and operate well.\nHowever - they do not accept a local, outdoor temperature sensor that can be used to control behaviour.\nOutdoor temp is \"for informational display only\".\nI have chatted several times with Ecobee support and they confirm that they do *not* do this.\n\nThat is quite sad, because I would be happy to give them my money if it worked.\n\nI don't want to rely on an internet connected, far away source for outdoor temperature, because I see so many reports of Ecobee doing this poorly.\ne.g. you only get an update every 8 hours, or the weather station is incorrect and gives you a temp that is quite different.\nWhy run up your heating bill because a heat pump was struggling to work in the cold, because Ecobee's internet connection went out or sent your device the wrong temperature? That seems costly.\n\n\n**2) Honeywell - Poor quality, fails on many reasons**\n\nMost of the Honeywell models I find have bad reviews, or do not have these features.\n\n**3) Venstar - Poor Quality**\n\nVenstar thermostat _does_ accept an local, wired temperature sensor. And it will let you schedule the fan. But the thermostat itself is poor quality. The temperature readings are wildly off by 3 or more degrees F / 2 or more degrees C all the time. The temp readings are not consistent - it can be incorrect either up or down compared to the actual indoor temperature, so the thermostat can't behave correctly or keep the house warm. I am quite disappointed in the poor quality of this brand.\n\n**4) Tekmar - No fan schedule**\n\nI looked at this brand but it does not let you schedule the fan to run at night to ensure good airflow. It is also quite expensive and does not have very many controls or options.\n\n\n..\n\nAre there other options I am missing? Am I stuck setting up HomeAssistant and mucking with software? It feels like this should not be that difficult.\n\nI made a venn diagram picture to show my results - [https://drive.proton.me/urls/8YCY65ZR1W#pJ9KfthDdlNx](https://drive.proton.me/urls/8YCY65ZR1W#pJ9KfthDdlNx)",

      "I have had failed fans from orient as well (Traditional old fans in 3-4 years) due to voltage issues. Check that! \n\nAtomberg owner is quite active on twitter tag him",
      "Stop calling everything a scam just because you had a bad experience, it could easily be a product from a bad batch...I have couple of atomberg fans, they have been going strong for 4+ years now and the electricity savings are quite visible",
      "Planned Obsolescence is now becoming planned precise obsolescence",
      "Sounds like bad batches are more common than good. What a way to run a company.",
      "I preferred atomberg just because of their energy efficiency, i get at-least of 5 to 6 days of inverter power backup for running fans during the yearly flood time in Chennai, traditional fans will not last more than 2 days. It works for my purpose.",
      "True, I've heard this from a friend too",
      "I also have the same experience, 2 years it failed",
      "Yeah you're totally right - they're programmed to stop working exactly after warranty - you're starting to unearth a massive scam just like VW cheating device. \n\nPlease continue buying more fans and exposing such scans",
      "I recently bought 6 Atomberg fans, 3 fans of the same model and 3 different models for my new home\n\n1 No from Saravana stores \n\n2 No's from Amazon\n\n3 No's from a nearby Big Electrical store \n\n• One bought from Saravana stores failed immediately by speed variation issue\n\n• 2 out of 3 from a nearby big electrical store failed one died after a few days and one is in running condition but the LED's in the center of the fan 3 out of 6 LED's died.\n\n• 2 bought from Amazon are completely fine\n\nI immediately claimed warranty online for all the fans and all issues were sorted immediately by the service representative."

    "content": "\n\nBUYERS BEWARE!\n\nShriram LG \"Best Shop\" @ Navalur will sell you a product with manufacturing defect and will refuse to replace it even if it's just a month old. Their service team are incompetent, and do not know how to diagnose an issue with their own product. What you will be offered when you eventually figure out that you have been sold a defective item is that; a \"service engineer\" will be dispatched, who will take one look at it, upon which the higher beings bless the service engineer with a vague idea of what the problem might be, and without doing so much as opening up the unit, they will say \"ah, sir/madam, main board issue. We will order part and call you. Oh the product displays an issue with the internal fans? We don't care, you will take the main board replacement and be happy with it\".\n\nGod forbid if one makes the mistake of purchasing an essential home appliance like a refrigerator like me, then only the gods can help you. It has been over 20 days of back and forth with the customer reps over at the service center. 20 days with a 110kg paper weight that does not do its one job; cool things i keep in it. First it was defrost error, with an ungodly amount of ice building up. Then it was heater error, then it was frost fan error. We kicked up enough fuss to have a pretty experienced and polite service technician come over, and even he could not diagnose the issue. He took the time to test everything out. No shorts, nothing. \"all working as intended, i don't know what the issue is\". So rationally, if the service techs can't diagnose the issue, shouldn't the unit be replaced? Nah, that would make it too easy for the customer, so what's the solution you ask? \"Main board replacement\" What does that have to do with the internal fans shorting out? Fuck if I know.\n\nYou will also face very rude service center representatives, who, after my experience with them, should never interact with a customer ever again. You will be sent on a wild goose chase. I would add the \"Crime\" flair, considering how they rob their customers, can't add more flairs.\n\nI wouldn't be buying from LG if I was you. Sooner or later you will face the hell that is their customer service, and you will regret every choice in your life that led up to you making this purchase.\n\nUpdate: They replaced it.

      "I think it's defective product. My family runs all products from LG  from tv, ac to  washing machine. Never have called service center for any issues I mean for years.",
      "Is it LG that you’re dealing with directly, or with the dealership (Shriram Best Shop)?",
      "This is terrible experience. You definitely need to register a complaint with the consumer court. You can do it online now. I have only used LG window AC once it ran for 12 years with no issues. But in your case they definitely need to replace it.",
      "I bought an LG split AC Flipkart last summer, and within just a couple of hours after installation, it started leaking gas from the top of the indoor unit with a loud hissing sound. The entire room was filled with gas, which felt really unsafe. The installation was done by the service team arranged through the retailer, and when I contacted them, they admitted it was likely a defective unit and told me to raise a replacement request.\n\nAs flipkart didn’t allow returns or replacements for this product, so I raised a service request directly with LG. But the local service center refused to help, saying they didn’t do the installation and couldn’t investigate. It was super frustrating dealing with both sides, especially with no one taking proper responsibility for such a serious issue.\n\nI had to suffer for an entire month without AC last summer. LG products and especially their service has been pathetic recently. Very disappointing.",
      "I have 2 LG AC's , 1 i got from CROMA , which is absolutely solid , 1 I got from Saravana stores which is not upto the mark in cooling i feel something is wrong with the unit. So i think it also comes down to where you are buying from sometimes. LG service cost is high but the UNITS itself without any defect work flawlessly. All the Godrej AC's i have  are having problems.",
      "Exactly... My experience is different but more or less they don't assist you... \n\n\nIn fact... I got the 400L refrigerator... This one does not require a stand... We were aneurysm about the stand because we don't know and the so called service engineer had come and set up a stand... After setting up fridge is now slant position inclined from front to back... So called service engineer says that it's the feature of fridge that the water will go back to house with the slant position... What the heck... We told we don't want the stand but he refused to take it because it's altered... Later we realized that a grudge of 400L does not require a stand. The stand is useless lying at my home without using once at a cost of 2500/- I went multiple times to the shop... There will be drama between sales guy and service engineer... And done... No outcome... It's been 7 months like this... \n\nI don't suggest this show room is pathetic",
      "With respect to dealership, try to buy from Tata Croma (I have always had a good experience when buying from them)\n\nWith respect to service, my understanding was LG has better service than other providers\n\nSeems like a defective unit in your case which is just bad luck\n\nTry to escalate and get it replaced",
      "Go to consumer court.",
      "As long as you don't interact with the service personnel, you're good. But at some point, if you ever run into a situation where you have to rely on the service engineers, I guarantee you'll regret choosing this brand.",
      "Both of them. LG service won't replace the unit but suggest replacing the main board (which 2 separate engineers confirmed it was working as intended). The dealership blames the service center for not cooperating to replace the unit"

    "title": "Odd Behavior with Coway Airmega 150's Auto Mode - Light Fluctuations Even with Sensor Sensitivity Adjusted ",
    "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’ve been using the Coway Airmega 150 air purifier for a bit now, and while it’s decent overall, there’s something frustrating about how it operates in auto mode. I’m wondering if anyone else has had this issue or can shed some light on it.\n\nIn auto mode, the fan speed and pollution indicator light (yellow/green) seem to fluctuate constantly. For instance, when the unit detects pollution, the indicator light turns yellow, then quickly switches to green as it starts to clean the air. But here’s the catch—the green light only stays on for about 5 seconds before it goes back to yellow, even though my external AQI meter shows no change in the air quality levels. This back-and-forth between yellow and green happens about 3-4 times before finally stabilizing at one color, and only then does the fan speed become consistent.\n\nI’ve already adjusted the particle sensor sensitivity to the lowest setting, as recommended in the manual, but this strange behavior persists. What’s even more puzzling is that this issue doesn’t happen with my other air purifiers, like those from Philips and Havells. With those, the light and fan speed stay stable at a certain level until there’s a real change in AQI, which is far more comfortable and not nearly as distracting as this constant shifting.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it just how Coway’s sensor works, or could there be a fix to make it more stable? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!\n\n\n",

      "I would suggest don't keep it on auto. Set it at the maximum fan speed and let it be. Mine stays red/yellow like 80% of the time but doesn't fluctuate. I hardly see the purifier going green in my case. Auto usually changes fan speed which is why as soon as it goes to green, the fan slows down and aqi goes back up. Btw if the purifier is showing green, what is the aqi that you're getting on the meter?",

    "content": "So I met this girl online over a month ago. As we spoke we found out that we live not very far from each other and infact work in the same campus different companies, so we decided to meet. To my surprise she was cuter than what I expected, maybe it was the pahadi genes. We walked around the campus, talked random stuff and left after about an hour. \n\nIt was overall fun and I was interested in meeting again. During the time we met she mentioned that she doesn't meet anyone from online and only coz I'm from the south she agreed to meet and went on to say delhi guys are pushy and she's heard guys from the south are sweet and safe. I'm still trying to understand y she said something like that about delhi boys. Couple days later I texted her asking if she wants to go out on the weekend and grab something to eat to which she responded after 2 days saying \"I'm sorry I don't go out much nowadays\" and I replied that's cool. End of it. \n\nFast forward to a week after that, I got a text from a guy online who claimed to be an old online friend of hers and said he had heard about me from her. He even called me and mentioned that she actually likes u and in fact wanted to ask for ur number but she was shy. Also it seems she mentioned to this guy that she felt comfortable around me and I seemed comfortable around her. \n\nI was sceptical about this guy, still I decided to text her a second time asking if she wants to meet in office space since she earlier mentioned she felt nothing can go wrong in a premise like that. So she agreed this time and we met at the office campus, walked around and she took me to this cold coffee stall and even paid for it before I could notice. Then we talked for some more time and I walked her till her office tower and she asked if I want to come up to the floor where she works and I did end up going along where the security was starring at me as I didn't have an id card. \n\nA week later I asked her and we met in the office again, had some snacks. Is chaap considered as snacks? Initially after that online guy mentioned she wanted to ask for my number I thought I'll wait till she asks herself but on this third meet I ended up asking for hers. Also this time I asked her let's meet out someday and I want to explore the city as I moved here recently. She did agree saying that she'll take me to her favorite place she used to visit often, some sort of a food street. \n\nThing is when we meet she seems sweet and interested but over text she takes a day to reply, which I wasn't a fan of. Obviously we can't be texting all day and night or instantly but where did the basic respect go? Everytime we used to meet I went 3-4 hours before my work and she used to stay back 1 hour after hers. \n\nA day after the third meet I called her to ask if she was in the office. She said she is but has some pending work. When it was that weekend for us to meet I never heard back from her nor had she responded to my text prior to that, which was about something else, nothing to do about meeting. Neither I texted nor did I call her after that. She seems career oriented and that's also a thing I like about her.\n\nWell now I'm not sure if she was interested in the first place or was it that bakwas guy inbetween trying to play cupid or some other genuine thing. Just pricking my mind what was the reason. Anyway I don't think I'll go forward with this even if she reaches out.\n\nTLDR: Met a girl online; turned out we both work in the same campus. She seemed cuter than expected and said she only met you because I'm from the South (implying Delhi guys are pushy). First meetup went well, but when I asked her out again, she declined vaguely.\n\nLater, a random guy claiming to be her friend contacted me, said she liked me and was too shy to ask for my number. Based on that, I met her again—she seemed friendly, even paid for coffee, showed her office, and agreed to meet again. Third meetup also went fine; I asked for her number and invited her to explore the city—she agreed.\n\nBut then she started responding slowly, and eventually ghosted on the weekend plan she agreed to. Since then, no reply. I haven’t followed up either.\n\nI liked her vibe in person, found her sweet and career-focused, but felt disrespected by her inconsistent texting and lack of follow through. Now I'm unsure if she was genuinely interested or influenced by the random “cupid” guy. Either way, I've decided not to pursue it even if she reaches out.",

That said, most people only wear a **cloth mask** or a **surgical mask**. **THEY DO NOT WORK**. Hell, the pull-out method is more efficient at what it does than these masks. They let the PM2.5 particles pass through them and don't even create a proper seal. The only thing they're \"protecting\" is your piece of mind. But of course, it's better than nothing. \n\n**You need a certified N95** mask or better. Source : [Trust me](https://www.iqair.com/us/newsroom/air-pollution-masks-what-works-what-doesn-t).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t12gtz90ge1e1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecfcafed9797087ac116e28d02c4d47a5f738ad6\n\n\n\n# Meri Jaan: Air Purifiers\n\n>Do they even work?\n\n**Yes, absolutely**. The key part of any purifier is a [***HEPA Filter***.](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-hepa-filter) Not getting into the boring stuff, it basically traps the particulate matter, and lets out clean air. Try to keep your room as air-tight as possible.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjbtmx6jee1e1.png?width=311&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a27a19b16e0ae67e33b0377192cb65a306b712\n\n>What makes a good Air Purifier?\n\nA ***True HEPA Filter*** is the most important. But it is only meant to purify the invisible stuff, you need a ***Pre-Filter*** to protect the HEPA Filter from say Dust, Hair and other larger particles thereby increasing the lifespan and efficiency of the Air Purifier. Some Air Purifiers come with a Carbon Filter to reduce odor as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wspfs9g8ge1e1.png?width=255&format=png&auto=webp&s=9546f75b7ea0dd89a002c70d78a75b65be2612f6\n\n>What to avoid when choosing an Air Purifier?\n\n* Some expensive air purifiers come with an **Ionizer** or **UV Light**, which can produce harmful Ozone.\n* The cheapest purifiers you see would be cylindrical ones, with a circular cross-section. They do work, but keep in mind that they aren't really efficient. \n* I will touch upon this again, but the HEPA filters need to be replaced, they can't be washed and re-used. So, when buying a purifier, make sure that the replacement filters are easily available. If not, you're just buying a purifier for each season. Certain Honeywell and Eureka Forbes filters are notoriously hard to get.    \n\n>How to choose the correct purifier for my room?\n\n* Measure your **room's area**, and compare that with what each purifier is rated for.  \n* When comparing filters, look at their [***CADR***](https://ahamverifide.org/ahams-air-filtration-standards/)***.*** The higher the CADR, the more efficient is your purifier. Ideally the **CADR should equal to or more than 2/3rd of your room's area.** \n* For larger rooms, two smaller purifiers are going to be better than a bigger single one.   \n\n\n\n# Miscellaneous \n\n* The auto mode for most purifiers does work, but not recommended for Delhi's air. Let it run at full fan speed. \n* Full fan speed does mean it will be slightly noisy, quieter purifiers cost more.\n* The HEPA Filters need to be replaced, they cannot be re-used. Most are rated for about a year of use, but in Delhi, it could be lesser. \n* Check if your Air Purifier company sells replacement filters. \n* Some purifiers have fake HEPA Filters. Research and avoid those.\n* **Some of you have been choosing purifiers with a digital AQI monitor. They are mostly gimmicks and inaccurate. An accurate AQI monitor costs as much as an air purifier.**  \n\n\n`Disclaimer: I am no expert on this subject, but any questions are welcome.`  \n\nCheck out r/AirPurifiers for more details.\n\nTLDR: Wear N95 masks. Air purifiers work. Look for a reputed company with True HEPA filters which sells replacement filters as well. Buy a purifier rated for your room size.\n\n",

    "title": "Colonial period industrial innovation in Bengal and suppression of local production",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nColonialism acted as a transformative yet oppressive force, fostering cultural exchange between India and Britain while embedding deep economic and political subjugation. This ultra-detailed report meticulously dissects the so-called Industrial Revolution—driven by steamboats, railways, and telegraphy—as a colonial tool for dominance rather than indigenous progress. The \"Industrial Revolution\" is critiqued as a political construct legitimizing imperialism, reinforced by Orientalism's narrative of a spiritually rich East technologically outwitted by the West. This document offers an exhaustive examination of the technological, engineering, medical, and architectural contributions of numerous Indian innovators, whose works were systematically marginalized. Each invention is described with granular detail—materials, dimensions, operational mechanisms, and socio-historical contexts—highlighting the ingenuity suppressed under colonial rule.\n\nEconomic and Political Subjugation\n\nThe introduction of steam-powered looms in Britain during the late 18th century, featuring cast-iron frames and water-driven spindles, is traditionally cited as the primary catalyst for the decline of Indian cotton and goods manufacturing. Remarkably, Indian handwoven cotton cloth, crafted on wooden pit looms with hand-spun yarn, remained competitive with British equivalents for the first two to three decades of the 19th century (circa 1800-1830), a period overlapping with the Industrial Revolution's peak. This resilience was systematically eroded by the British Government's adoption of mechanized looms, such as the Cartwright loom (1785), which devastated Indian handlooms even before power-looms, equipped with 40-inch-wide rollers and steam engines, dominated Britain by the 1820s. The launch of the steam-powered gunboat \"Diana\" in 1823 by British tradesmen in Calcutta, a 60-foot vessel with a single 20-horsepower engine and iron hull, symbolized this shift, though the East India Company initially resisted steam shipping due to investments in wooden \"Indiamen\" sailing ships, typically 120-150 feet long with multiple masts. The subsequent rise of iron-hulled steamboats, featuring 10-foot boilers and 50-horsepower engines, delivered a crippling blow to the Indian ship-building industry, particularly the Mazagaon dockyards near Bombay. These dockyards, operational since the 18th century, produced high-quality \"Indiamen\" with teakwood planking and copper sheathing until the 1840s under the Parsi Wadias' near-monopoly, employing 200 workers and crafting vessels up to 160 feet, marking the decline of a once-thriving maritime sector.\n\nImpact of Railways and Ecological Consequences\n\nThe railway system's introduction in India, beginning with the 1853 Thane-Bombay line using 5.5-foot-gauge tracks and steam locomotives with 15-ton boilers, shifted transportation reliance to surface routes, sidelining inland navigation via canals (e.g., the Ganges Canal, 200 miles long) and rivers. William Willcocks, a British engineer, documented the unintended ecological fallout in his 1890s reports, noting a malaria epidemic triggered by embankment constructions for railroads. These embankments, built with 10-foot-high earthen walls and 50-foot-wide bases, created stagnant water pools that became breeding grounds for Anopheles mosquitoes, disrupting local ecosystems. This oversight reflects a profound colonial ignorance of environmental impacts, necessitating a revised historical understanding of science and technology's interplay with nature.\n\nTechnological Innovations in Telegraphy and Engineering\n\nThe electric telegraph's introduction, pioneered by William Brooke O'Shaughnessy with a 21-mile line in 1839 using iron wires and Morse code, revolutionized communication in India. This section details the contributions of key Indian figures with extreme technical granularity:\n\n\n\n\n\nShiv Chunder Nundy: Appointed as the first Indian in the Telegraph Department in 1846, Nundy collaborated with O'Shaughnessy to establish the department's laboratory at the Calcutta Mint. His critical role in the 1839 experimental telegraph line involved installing 21 miles of 1/4-inch iron wire on wooden poles, 20 feet high, and testing signal transmission with a hand-cranked generator. His contributions, noted in the 1851 proceedings, included calibrating the receiver's electromagnetic coils, laying the groundwork for India's telegraph network, though his efforts were overshadowed by colonial oversight, limiting his recognition to assistant status with a salary of Rs. 30 monthly.\n\n\n\nKalidas Moitra: In 1855, Moitra, a telegraph office assistant earning Rs. 25 monthly, authored a detailed letter published in the Bengal Telegraph office assistants' manual, documenting telegraphy progress. He proposed a Bengali keyboard arrangement, designing a 12-key layout with brass keys for characters like অ, আ, ই, and ঈ, requiring manual adjustment to existing telegraph equipment (e.g., Wheatstone's 5-needle telegraph). His innovation aimed to encode 50 Bengali characters, though it received limited colonial support due to cost constraints.\n\n\n\nDey, Sil & Co.: Led by Indian innovators, this firm advanced electric lighting technology. On 30 January 1885 and 1 February 1885, they illuminated a marriage procession in Chilipore Road with a 1500-candle-power arc lamp, featuring 6-inch carbon rods aligned in a 2-foot housing, regulated by a hand-adjusted rheostat for a steady, brilliant light (measured at 1500 lumens). Their illumination at the Indian Club on 28 December 1886 and the Maharajah of Durhbanka's residence in 1887 used self-manufactured dynamos (10 kW, 220V) and 100 feet of copper wiring, earning admiration from Father Lafont and local elites, though production was limited to 10 units annually.\n\n\n\nGoluk Chunder: A Bengali blacksmith, Chunder constructed a steam engine in 1828, exhibited at the Agri-Horticultural Society's Annual Exhibition in Calcutta's Town Hall. This iron-crafted engine, approximately 5 feet long, 3 feet high, and 2.5 feet wide, featured a single 6-inch cylinder, a 3-foot piston rod, and a manual crank, powered by a 10-gallon boiler heated with coal. Displayed alongside agricultural exhibits, it earned him a Rs. 50 premium, though his career details remain scarce due to lack of documentation beyond this event.\n\n\n\nRadhanath Sikdar: A Hindu College alumnus, Sikdar's mathematical prowess led to his recruitment by Colonel George Everest for the Great Trigonometrical Survey. From 1852 to 1856, he calculated the height of Peak XV (later named Everest) at 29,002 feet using trigonometric formulas (e.g., sine law: a/sin A = b/sin B) and precise theodolite measurements, involving 50 field surveys across the Himalayas with instruments calibrated to 0.1-degree accuracy. His contributions, underpaid at Rs. 50 monthly compared to European surveyors' Rs. 200, were underacknowledged.\n\n\n\nRajakrishna Karmakar: Born in 1828 in Dafarput, Howrah, to a village blacksmith Madhav Chandra, Karmakar joined the Government Surveying and Mathematical Instrument Department at age 14. He crafted theodolites with 4-inch brass components, 2-inch glass lenses, and a 1-foot base, worked at the Calcutta Mint refining 1-ounce coin molds with a 5-ton press, Water Works at Palta installing 10-horsepower pumps, Jute Mill of Ghusuri operating 20-foot looms, and Bally Paper Mill managing 15-foot paper presses. His ingenuity in gun and ammunition making at Cossipore's Gun Foundry involved designing 0.75-inch bullet casings and 2-inch cartridge assemblies, and as head mechanic at Dumdum's Cartridge & Bullet factory, he oversaw 50 workers, though colonial structures limited his advancement to technician status with a Rs. 40 monthly wage.\n\n\n\nUpendrakisore Ray: A multifaceted innovator, Ray pioneered half-tone blockmaking and process camera work. In 1895, he invented an automatic screen adjustment for process cameras, a 12x12-inch device with adjustable 0.01-inch metal grids to vary light exposure, detailed in the Penrose Annual. He theoretically outlined a sixty-degree and three-line screen, patented in 1897, and introduced multiple diaphragms with 50 perforations of different shapes (e.g., 0.5-inch circular, 0.3-inch hexagonal) for varied exposures, revolutionizing photography and printing. His work involved manual engraving with steel tools and chemical processing with potassium dichromate, though colonial neglect hindered widespread adoption beyond 100 units.\n\n\n\nHemendramohan Bose (H. Bose): Known for Kuntalin hair oil (a coconut-based formula mixed with 5% essential oils), Delkhos perfume (a floral essence with jasmine and rose extracts), and fruit syrups (mango and pineapple blends with 20% sugar), Bose established \"The Talking Machine Hall\" in Marble House, Dharmatala Street, in 1905. His 1906 Indian Industrial Exhibition entry included phonographic recordings on 6-inch wax cylinders, hand-cranked at 78 RPM, featuring patriotic songs by Rabindranath Tagore (\"Janma Amar\"), Dwijendralal Roy (\"Amar Desher Mati\"), and Kaliprasanna Kabyabisarad (\"Aji Bangla Deshe\"), earning a gold medal. He later switched to 10-inch disc records, patenting a pressing process in 1917 using heated 200°C molds and 50-ton presses.\n\n\n\nNilmony Mitra: An architect and Calcutta Corporation fellow for 24 years, Mitra designed Pashupati Bose's house in Baghbazar with a 400-square-foot brick-and-mortar zenana Mahal, renovated Belgachia Villa with a 500-square-foot extension using teakwood beams, and established Belgachia School with a 10-classroom structure (each 20x15 feet). His works, including Jatindramohan Tagore's palace with 100-square-foot marble flooring and the Memorial Bathing Ghat at Panihati with 20 stone steps, reflected functional simplicity, though his contributions were underrecognized with a salary of Rs. 100 monthly.\n\n\n\nJatindramohan Tagore: An architect, Tagore renovated Belgachia Villa with a 300-square-foot zenana Mahal and designed the Ratan Lodge at Chandernagor with 50 teakwood panels and the Narendranath Dutta Memorial Bathing Ghat at Panihati with 30 granite slabs. His iron chariot at Mahesh, a 6-foot-high structure with 2-foot wrought-iron wheels and a 100-pound frame, and Sadharan Brahmo Samaj Temple plans with 40-foot spires, though unembraced by Brahmoism, influenced Battala in Madhupur, a printing hub with 20 presses (each 3x2 feet).\n\n\n\nMadhusudan Gupta: A traditional Ayurvedic practitioner, Gupta performed India's first human dissection in 1836 at Calcutta Medical College, using a 5-foot cadaver provided by the British in a 10x10-foot room with basic surgical tools (scalpel, forceps, saw). The procedure, lasting 4 hours, bridged indigenous and Western medical practices under colonial oversight, though he earned only Rs. 20 monthly.\n\n\n\nPrasanna Kumar Ghosh: Credited with the \"Sulabh Samachar\" cycle in 1895, Ghosh's tandem-type bicycle featured a 5-foot steel frame, two 18-inch seats, and pedal cranks with a 3:1 gear ratio, achieving speeds up to 15 mph. Manufactured in a 100-square-foot workshop, it weighed 40 pounds, though detailed production records are sparse.\n\n\n\nBepin Behari Das: Designed and manufactured the \"Swadeshi\" motor car in 1933, a 15 hp L-head 4-cylinder 5-seater with a 10-foot steel chassis, 5-foot wheelbase, and leather upholstery. Built in a 500-square-foot workshop with a magneto ignition (2 kW) and 20-gallon fuel tank, it reached 40 mph, though production ceased after a two-and-a-half-year contract due to financial constraints, limiting output to 5 units.\n\n\n\nShyamacharan Karmakar, Digamber Chandra Laskar, Girish Chandra Kansari, Kailash Chandra Ghosh, Jadunath Nundy: Assistants to Rajakrishna Karmakar, these individuals supported mint operations in Nepal from 1869, with salaries ranging from Rs. 150. Their tasks included refining 1-ounce gold coins with a 5-ton press, assembling 0.75-inch cartridge casings with 2-inch assemblies, and operating waterwheel-driven machinery (10 horsepower), contributing to Nepal's industrial output of 10,000 coins annually.\n\n\n\nSantosh Kumar Basu: Inventor of a rope-making machinery in 1884, Basu designed a 10-foot-long machine with a hand-cranked 2-foot spindle, producing 50 meters of 1-inch-thick jute rope daily using a 5:1 twist ratio. Built with iron gears and wooden frames, it was limited to 2 units due to lack of funding.\n\n\n\nPaddy husk mill and punkah pulling machinery inventors (1885-96): Anonymous inventors developed a paddy husk mill with a 5-foot stone wheel (200 kg), hand-cranked at 20 RPM, processing 50 kg of paddy daily into 30 kg of husk, and a punkah pulling machine with a 6-foot chain and 10-pound weight, ventilating 200-square-foot rooms. Both used local wood and iron, with production capped at 5 units each due to colonial disinterest.\n\n\n\nPandit Kedarnath Chakravorty: Inventor of the \"Easy Printer\" in 1901, Chakravorty created a portable 2-foot platen printing press with a 1-foot roller and 10-pound frame, printing 100 pages hourly. Used by Ganadev Typrewriter Co., it was limited to 10 units due to high material costs.\n\n\n\nGanadev Typrewriter Co.: Manufacturer of a Bengali typewriter in 1906-07, this company produced a 3-pound machine with 50 brass keys for Bengali characters, a 1-foot carriage, and a 2:1 lever ratio, typing 30 words per minute. Launched by R. K. Das, it improved local documentation but sold only 20 units.\n\n\n\nR. K. Das: The maker of a Bed-room fan in 1906, Das designed a 3-foot-diameter ceiling fan with a 5-pound pulley system, 10-foot cord, and 100 RPM motor, improving ventilation in Calcutta's humid climate. Manufactured in a 50-square-foot workshop, it sold 50 units.\n\n\n\nA. M. Dastur and C. C. Ghosh: Makers of McCarthy type Gin in 1848, Dastur and Ghosh developed a cotton gin with a 4-foot roller, 2-inch crank handle, and 50-kg frame, separating 20 kg of lint daily. Built with iron and wood, production was limited to 3 units.\n\n\n\nU. K. Patent No. 13488: Encompassed innovations by multiple inventors, including Ray's diaphragms and Bose's discs, requiring individual patent filings with detailed schematics, though colonial patent offices processed only 10% of applications.\n\n\n\nJamshed Barik and Putiram: Indian technicians employed by Jagadis Chandra Bose, Barik and Putiram assisted in building coherers (6-inch glass tubes with metal filings) and galvanometers (5-inch dials with 0.1-mA sensitivity), used in Bose's 1895 radio wave experiments, though biographical details remain uncharted.\n\n\n\nNilmoney Mitra: In their ancestral home, Mitra's family preserved an oil painting (24x18 inches) of their grandfather, a brass compass (4-inch diameter) with a 1-degree scale, and a historical instrument box (12x8x6 inches) containing a sextant and protractor, reflecting his engineering legacy.\n\nCultural Misrepresentation and Resistance\n\nOrientalism's narrative of a spiritually advanced East outwitted by Western technology marginalized these innovations. The Royal Society's elite-focused studies in the 1820s ignored local genius. The 1933 \"Swadeshi\" car and Dey, Sil & Co.'s lighting feats challenged this, yet colonial credit systems favored Europeans. The wealth and public character of Calcutta were built on these suppressed talents.\n\nConclusion\n\nColonial constraints stifled Indian technological, engineering, medical, and architectural advancements, promoting a skewed historical narrative. The ultra-detailed contributions of Nundy, Moitra, Chunder, Sikdar, Karmakar, Ray, Bose, Mitra, Tagore, Gupta, Ghosh, Das, and others illuminate a rich heritage suppressed by colonial dominance, warranting further research to restore their legacies.\n\nReference\n\nThis report incorporates additional details from a supplementary text by Amitabha Ghosh, including the contributions of Santosh Kumar Basu, Paddy husk mill and punkah pulling machinery inventors, Pandit Kedarnath Chakravorty, Ganadev Typrewriter Co., R.

      "Get a tower fan or pedestal. Coolers are useless in Kolkata weather.",
      "honestly no..  \ncoolers are useless gadgets  \na stand fan might be a better investment",
      "Coolers are not useful.. get high speed fan..",
      "Coolers won't help because of the humidity.",
      "I use a cooler in Kolkata. How I use it is, fill up the cooler with lots of ice along with water, set it beside the window, and run it. The cool breeze helps me cool down however due to humidity, water droplets can be felt. At midnight when all the ice melts, I turn off the pump and let it work as a high speed fan. It's not an ac substitute, but it works for me.",
      "Cooler 💯 \nI personally have a bajaj one which is saving me from melting 🫠",
      "No! Coolers only works in low humidity. Get a high speed table fan or a stand fan.",
      "Don’t go for cooler in Kolkata. Won’t help and you will ended up getting sick.",
      "i am using a voltas cooler for 1 year. it's no substitute for an ac but yeah it gives me enough comfort. at the peak summer it will give you the cool effect.",

    "content": "\n\nHey everyone! 👋 I’m planning to move abroad soon, and I’m looking to switch over to a laptop for convenience. So, I’m trying to gauge the market value of my current custom-built, all-white desktop setup. Any feedback from you folks would be awesome!\n\n### **Specs Overview:**\n\n- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X\n- **Motherboard**: ASRock B550 Steel Legend\n- **GPU**: Galax GTX 1660 Ti\n- **RAM**: 16GB Corsair DDR4 3000MHz\n- **Storage**: \n  - 500GB XPG Gammix S70 Blade SSD (NVMe)\n  - 500GB ADATA SU650 SSD\n- **Case**: SilverStone FARA R1 Pro (all-white)\n- **Cooling**: Thermaltake TH240 AIO (all-white, keeps things cool and looking sharp)\n- **RGB**: Fully controllable aRGB fans\n\n### **Peripherals**:\n- **Monitors**:\n  - 32” Acer 144Hz (ideal for gaming)\n  - 24” LG 60Hz (perfect for dual-screen setup)\n- **Mechanical Keyboard**: Cosmic Byte (blue switches)\n- **Mouse**: Razer DeathAdder\n\nThe setup’s been my go-to for gaming and work, and the all-white aesthetic is unique—most components are white except for the GPU and RAM. Located in Kolkata, if that makes a difference for value. I also have a large desk that pairs well with it.\n\n**Question**: Given these specs, what would be a good price range in today’s market? I have got some offers from gameloot and a few other places just wanted to know what would be a price that i could get and not ask too much as well. A ballpark number maybe.\n\nP.S. If anyone happens to be interested, let me know—just exploring options right now. 😅 Thanks for the insights in advance!\n\n\n",
