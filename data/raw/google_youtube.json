    "transcript": "i have spent more time trying to make ceiling fan smart than any other smart home product in my home now this one is currently smart but it's using this really complicated setup over here where you need to push this and then you need to push that and turn this and i'm the only one in my house that actually knows how to use those functions with the voice assistant well the good news is hunter fan company has a solution to solve all of these problems hunter fan company did send these to me today for this review so first off we have a new fan here now this is the advocate collection but there are a bunch of new fans that have what is called simple connect technology so this will allow you to connect your fan via your favorite voice assistant whether it be apple homekit google assistant or amazon's voice assistant so first off we're going to get this set up and installed that does connect over wi-fi and then the next thing we're going to do is show you how you can control this fan right from your light switch with the ceiling fan remote wall control the specific fan i'll be using today is a 54 inch advocate collection which is wi-fi connected has an integrated led light bulb and it does have reversible blades as well you got the noble bronze or the black walnut and then it has a cased white glass so there will be some electrical required to get this set up so one way we will be able to control this is with this included fan remote and then follow the instructions you should be good to go the first thing we will need to do is turn off the power to our existing fan and now remove it piece by piece by piece by piece like these by piece by piece by piece by piece by piece yeah now we are ready to install the new one next we're going to add the bracket now there are two ways which you can do this one you could use machine screws in a fan rated box or here i'm going to drill into the joist and pre-drill some holes to use the wood screws to install the bracket next i'm going to hang the fan onto the bracket and then we're going to do the wiring here you have the ground on the bracket then we have the black the white and the blue now because i only have one switch i will not be using the blue but if you have a fan and a light switch you would use the black for the light and the blue for the fan so for the wiring i'm going to take the green cable and attach it to the ground with the included wire nuts and then i'm going to take the black attach it to the black and the white attach it to the white and since i won't be using the blue cable i'm just going to put a wire nut on it and then i'm going to tuck the wiring in so that i'm ready to mount the fan first we're going to add some slots with screws for the fan to hang on then we're going to hang up the fan add and tighten the screws then we're going to snap the canopy covers into place then we're gonna take a screw add a washer and install the four fan blades that was easy then we're gonna add the light kit assembly lower switch housing and the led assembly so this does not actually have light bulbs it has this little led and we're going to attach that and then plug in the white to the white and the blue to the black and then we're going to add the glass and it is installed now that the power is back on the fan is ready to be used so here on our remote we can easily turn on and off the light with the button and then you can actually change the brightness by holding down i'm gonna hold down the button and there it's going to go dim so that was its dimmest level now let's go ahead and hold down the button to turn up the brightness and there we go as you can see that definitely fills up the room with light and it gets much brighter than the light that we had before that's awesome and then here we have the option to change the fan speed so i can use these controls so it looks like it's at the fastest and then we can turn it down and then we can push the button to turn it off now let's go ahead and get this set up with the simple connect app this is available on android and ios devices once we have it downloaded let's open it up here it's mentioning that we'll be able to control everything right from the palm of our hand and i'm going to go ahead and create an account once we have confirmed our account we're going to head back to the app and add a device and then we're going to make sure the power is powered on now this will connect to a wi-fi that has 2.4 gigahertz most likely your wi-fi will have that even though it may not show 2.4 and 5 gigahertz next we're going to use the remote and pull off the battery panel here and then we're going to hold the button down until it makes a tone and is in pairing mode just like that the lights will flash and then we need to scan a qr code which is found on the battery cover inside and then it wants us to put in the eight digit code here and now we are going to choose the wi-fi network we want it to connect to and enter the password all right and it has successfully connected to the wi-fi so now we're going to link our account and now it has been linked to our account so here we have the option to control our simple connect fan we can simply adjust the light by turning on light and then down below we can adjust the brightness as well next let's turn on the fan now it will go to the last speed in which you did have the fan and it does take a little bit to turn on but there we go and here you can see it's ramping up to 100 percent and then i can turn down the speed and it is a nice breeze in the home now let's look at the advanced options so if you did have a separate light switch and fan switch you can turn this on here to split the fan but i don't have that so we're going to turn it off then you have the option to have audio feedback so it will beep when you adjust the fan you can also have the fan go to reverse and you can turn off the dimming so it no longer will dim so now i do have that option once it is on and at the bottom here we have the option to rename the fan so we're just going to call this kitchen fan and then we're going to save that and then let's go ahead and give the light a name and this is above the couch so i'm going to call it couch light you could also call it fan light or whatever you want and if you do have multiple fans you do have the option for rooms down here so you can adjust the naming of the room but now let's go ahead and add this to our different smart home apps let's start with the google assistant for this we're going to head into the google home app we're going to select the plus at the top left and then select setup device and works with google and then we're going to search for simple connect here it is so we tap on that and then we need to sign into our account and then we need to authorize access it has now linked our account to the google home app so if we go back to the main page and scroll down to the bottom under the link to you section we'll find the simple connect light here we can tap on the light we have the option to turn the light on and off and then we can also adjust the brightness but if we click add to room we can then organize it into our home i'm then going to do the same for the simple connect fan and at the top here we can also adjust the name to whatever we'd like so now i can turn off all the lights in the kitchen by tapping right here and then also if i tap on the kitchen fan i can then simply turn it on and off now let's test this on the nest hub max turn off couch light set couch light to 100 brightness hey google turn on kitchen fan got it turning on kitchen fan [Music] set kitchen fan too high sure setting kitchen fan speed to high and then i like here on the smart display i have the option to see all the different speeds as well as tap to adjust turn off kitchen fan all right turning off kitchen fan all right now let's go ahead and link this with amazon alexa on the simple connect home screen tap the settings and here we have alexa integration and then we're going to tap enable and then we're going to sign into our account and authorize once it finds the devices you'll see at the top here to view the new discovered devices and here we can see that we have our couch light and our kitchen fan and then i'm going to scroll down and go into my kitchen group and add both of those devices to the kitchen so here i have the couch light i can tap on it i can adjust it by turning it on and off right from the app i also have the brightness controls and so on and here with the kitchen fan when i tap on it i have the option to turn it on and off and then i also can adjust the percentage or the speed of the fan let's test it out on the echo show turn on couch light set couch light to 100 brightness [Music] alexa increase kitchen fan [Music] alexa turn off kitchen fan and to set this up with apple home kit we will need to sign in to the simple connect app here i'm using the ipad and then i will need to sign into my account and then i will need to use the home kit code that can be found in the cover of the controller then i need to select to add the fan to the home once the fan is connected we'll then give it a location in a room and then we can give it a name and then here in the kitchen room we have the option to turn on and off the fan and we can adjust the brightness of the light and here we have the quick control to turn off the light let's go ahead and test it out with siri hey siri turn off hunter light okay the hunter light is off hey siri turn on hunter light okay the hunter light is on hey siri turn on hunter fan done hey siri set hunter fan to low okay i set the hunter fan to 25 hey siri turn off hunter okay the hunter fan is off we now have our simple connect fan connected to the internet and working with all the voice assistants and that is working great but let's talk about the other way in which we are going to use this fan which is over here from the wall and with the remote so first off with the wall switch if we turn that off it's going to turn off the light and the fan because there's no longer power going to the fan and we can come over here and turn it back on and the light comes back on the fan does kick on but if you do turn off the wall switch you are not able to use those voice assistants anymore so first let me talk to you about how you can control the fan with the remote and then let me show you a way in which we can solve the problem of the light switch being turned off so looking at the remote this is actually one of the most advanced fan remotes i've ever seen now there's only a few buttons but if you look at the guide you can see all the different things that we can do so we can turn on and off the light just by pushing the button but if the lights on and then we push and hold the button down that will actually adjust the brightness right from the light which is really cool so then if we quick press that will turn the light off next we have the fan so if we press the fan it will turn the fan on or off then if we want to adjust the speed we then push the button up so let's see is the fan on nope so i turn on the fan and then i increase the speed all right and the speed is going up so i can go faster speed and then i can go lower speed now if i want to reverse the fan so if i want it to go in the other direction for winter or for summer you would hold down on the fan button and then that would reverse the speed now you have a few other options so here we can do fan updraft where we long press the fan and the up we can do fan down draft where we long press the fan and down we can do dimming mode off so if you don't want it to dim you can hold down the up and down arrow at the same time you can also enable beep so let's do that if we hold down the volume and the up button now the fan is going to beep when we use controls so if i turn on the light it will give a beep indication saying it was done and that is the sound for turning off and then to disable the beep you're going to hold down the light and down and so that is how you can control the simple connect fan with the remote now let's head over and talk about the light switch so here we have the hunter ceiling fan remote wall control now this allows us to do all the functions we had on the remote and this also is compatible with other hunter fans that have receivers so here in the box there's the wall control it does come with a hunter faceplate there and then here on the back we have ground and we have the load going to the fan and the power going to the switch as well as placement for two double a batteries and in the box it does come with the batteries as well as some wire nuts and other screws to get this mounted and set up and here is a little quick control guide and again has very similar functions to the remote that i just showed you let's go ahead turn off the power get this installed after removing our switch now let's go ahead and put in the batteries this does have a battery cover you can place on as well now i'm not exactly sure why you need batteries and to wire this but that's what we need to do next we're going to connect the wires so first we're going to use the green and connect it to the ground here that is the unsheathed copper wire back here next on the back of the wall control you'll see a picture of a fan and we're going to connect that to the wire that goes to the fan or the load wire and then next we have the vac wire which is going to be connected to the line that comes into this light switch once that is done we're going to press all the wires back into the light box and then we're going to attach the wall control and add a face plate then within three minutes of turning on the power hold down the light and the fan button it will then flash and it is now paired to the fan and now our wall control is set up and ready to go now if you don't want to pick up a wall control you also can mount the remote right to the wall the back of this just pops off like that and then you can screw that in the wall and then you snap this on and then you are able to easily place your remote which is really nice but i like having this built in and the option where somebody's not going to turn off the light switch so now let me walk you through the functions of the wall control okay so first off we can turn on and off the light so simple press of the button and the light turns on and off if we hold down the up arrow that will push the light at the full brightness and then if we hold down the down arrow that will put it to the most dim level next we have the option for the fan so if we press that will simply turn on the fan to whatever state it was now it does take a couple seconds for it to engage but there it goes and then we have six different levels of speed that we can use now this does use the surespeed technology which immediately you feel a nice breeze once this fan is enabled so let's go ahead and decrease the speed down on the fan all right so here it is at speed one and then we can push the up arrow to increase the speed and just like the light if we hold down up that will change the fan to full speed and then it will cool off the room and then when we're done using the fan we can simply just press the fan button and it will turn off and then when we're ready to turn it back on we push the fan button it turns it back on to the speed we were using now one thing about the wall control is you do have a full power so if you want to completely kill the power to the fan you can press the power button here on the bottom but that does totally turn off the power so right now none of these smart functions will be able to work you need to have that pressed in and powered on so that you are able to use the full functions of the fan so i would just use the light and the fan button to have full control whether you're going to use smart control or whether you're going to be using the wall control here so after using this simple connect fan for a few days i'm very impressed now right now i have it on full speed and it does produce a little extra sound but one of the most impressive things is the air in which it is pushing through this room so on a hot summer's day this is going to be the perfect addition to our home now i've really enjoyed that this can connect with all the different smart devices works with google set kitchen fan to medium sure setting kitchen fan speed to media all right there i was able to change the fan speed and it changes pretty quickly i like that it works with google amazon as well as apple and i'm actually very impressed with how quickly home kit was able to work haven't used that as much as the other ones now one of my favorite things is being able to have the full control right on the remote there's no more little dangly things to control the light and then i also love the new integration of the wall control i think i'm going to go out and buy one of these for all the fans that i have that are hunter have the wireless remote already i just need to put one of those in the wall switch and then that will solve so many problems with people being able to still use the smart controls and then being able to control the fan right from the wall which is just a huge thing in the improvement of smart fans because i've tried out a ton and there's always a problem and this solves so many of those different problems so overall the simple connect fan is really a great product and something i can definitely recommend if i were to make any changes i would love to see it connect with the smart things platform and then i'd also love to see just a little faster integration between the app and the fan now when using this with voice assistance it actually works really good hey siri turn off the hunter light okay the hunter light is off pretty quick hey google turn on couch light just a second longer there but overall very impressed with the speed that it will work with your voice assistance now with all of this you also have the option to create different routines where it can automatically turn on the lights or the fan at different times of the day and different times of the year depending on what you need for your home so if you have any further questions about this fan please let me know in the comments below and if you'd like to pick up one of your own i will leave a link in the description below so if you want to check out more of my smart home you can see a full tour right there or other smart home videos down there thank you so much for watching we'll see you on the next one"

    "transcript": "so you want to make your ceiling fan smart but you're not exactly sure where to start or what might work best for your fan or your current setup honestly these days it seems to be getting more and more confusing actually as we have different fans different switches all kinds of stuff out there with many ceiling fan motors being DC powered you also have AC powered fans fans with remotes fans with single or double wall switches and any combination of the above so I'll break it all down today and show you what is the best option for you based on your current fan or setup let's go yo what's up guys my name is Shane and this channel is all about building an easy apple Home Smart home with new videos and live streams published every week all right so I recently installed a total of five maybe six different ceiling fans throughout my house all of which you know I had to make smart and connect to to my Apple home setup I've also done the same thing for one or two friends recently so this has definitely been a relevant topic for me lately even with my pretty decent understanding of smart home connectivity and my ability to install stealing fans I still found myself a little bit confused at times as to what would be the best option and what might work best for my setup or my friend's setup now there are actually you know pretty big factors that I didn't even realize were factors until recently regarding compatibility of fans and stuff so I figured I'd share everything I've learned today and hopefully help some of you out there who may also want to make your ceiling fan smart first let's send some love to today's sponsor Best Buy as we are quickly approaching the holiday shopping season don't forget to check out the Best Buy weekly and daily top

current top deals and thanks again to Best Buy for sponsoring today's video so let's discuss all the options to make your ceiling fans smart and the possible setups or scenarios now I do have chapters Below in in case you need to skip around to any certain part disclaimer I am not a certified or professional electrician in any shape or form so do keep that in mind but I have changed a lot of smart light switches and fan switches and sealin fans and stuff like that so um you know just keep that in mind but if you're ever uncomfortable or unsure certainly consult a professional electrician in fact I would recommend doing that anyways I have done that myself uh more than once to make sure I'm doing doing things right or if I ever have any questions or things like that or just have them do it completely if you're not sure where to begin let's take a look at the fan itself there are smart ceiling fans out there but there really aren't many that support apple home if that's something you're into like me on top of that if you have a wall switch that you use currently to control your fan and you would like to continue to use that wall switch a smart fan is probably not the best option it operates much like a smart bulb you know in that sense uh meaning every time somebody turns off the switch at the wall it will kill the Smart Home Connection and all your automations and stuff like that for your fan so for this reason and because my wife would probably just flip those switches mess up my automations just to drive me crazy I typically prefer using a Smart Switch if at all possible that also allows you to kind of essentially be able to use any smart ceiling fan you want so you're not limited to certain you know style or type just because it has smart home connectivity you can use any dumb you know ceiling fan that you want now we will definitely come back to switches more in a minute but do know that if you have a ceiling fan without a wall switch or you're fine with you know never using the wall switch in the future then a smart ceiling fan could be a good option for you you know this will give you onoff capability and should also give you speed control in apple home for example or whatever smart home ecosystem you use but otherwise I do usually recommend not using a smart fan or using that smart home capability that might be built into the fan at least if you have a wall switch that you want to keep using that leads us to Smart switches now there's really two options here uh a number of onoff switches you know just simple onof will work with smart fans or you can go with a smart fan switch or fan controller kind of like a dimmer for your fan so this not only will give you onoff control but also speed control of your fan there's a number of different ones out there you know made by different brands such as Lutron CA Maris levaton probably others most of these uh if not all of these do require a neutral wire though so do be aware of that in order to connect to your fan so just make sure you have that available you know in your switch box and if you do want to use you know a dedicated fan controller switch you will need need an existing wall switch that controls only your ceiling fan so can't control the ceiling fan and the light uh most modern houses at least in the US are built this way I think I you know you usually do see a separate switch for the light and a separate you know another one for the fan that's how my house is set up so I actually always thought it would be pretty easy to make this smart right just get any ceiling fan that I want install a Smart Switch like the Lutron fan controller switch or any fan controller switch and I'd be good to go right wrong not all fans will work with these fan controller switches as I have recently discovered so what fan do you buy or will your existing fan work with a smart fan switch ceiling fan motors can either be AC powered which is probably the more you know Common typical type or they can be DC powered nowadays we're seeing more and more DC powered ceiling fans now ideally if you plan to use a smart switch for your fan you'll want an AC powered fan if at all possible this will allow you to have speed control at the switch and through your smart apps and stuff AC powered fans should have again no problem working with your smart switches or smart fan controllers now if your AC powered fan comes with a remote I I will usually just disregard that little receiver that you install you know in the ceiling canopy you can basically disregard this and wire the ceiling fan and light directly to the ceiling so for me this just makes things a little bit easier since you can control the fan speed using your smart home I would just rather not have the remote you know available to make things more complicated so I usually just disregard that altogether if your fan comes with a remote the receiver will look something like this if the receiver is slightly different and looks something like this the wiring from this one then you probably have a DC powered fan now as mentioned more and more fans now are d DC powered you should also be able to see if a fan motor is DC powered labeled on the box somewhere although it may be hard to fine now again if you intend to use a Smart fan controller switch at the wall I would go with an AC powered fan if at all possible if not possible well then we do have some options here still just not as ideal two of my recent fan installations were DC fans the big fan for my living room and an outdoor rated fan for my back porch are both DC powered the big issue with the DC powered motors is that you cannot bypass the little receiver device like we did with the AC powered fans because that is needed to convert the AC power to DC power for your fan motor and uh you know those smart dimmer like switches the fan control switches that give you the speed control will not work with DC powered motors so here's what I did for the ceiling fan light I did bypass that receiver in the ceiling so if your fan has a light built in there should be a single wire labeled light you can wire that directly to the ceiling you know where your wires come out there and again this is all as long as you do have separate wiring you know separate switches and wiring for two switches one for the light and one for the ceiling fan then I wire up the ceiling fan motor as instructed in the product manual using the receiver device that will get connected to the second load wire coming out of the ceiling for the second switch now one light switch should turn on and off the light and the other should turn on and off the fan for the light you should be able to use any Smart Switch or dimmer so that's nice now for the fan though you will not be able to use a dimmer or a fan controller switch like the Lutron cassa fan controller the only option here is for a Smart Switch or a relay with just a simple onoff capability no dimming uh and again that's because this is controlling a DC powered fan motor I actually reached out to Lutron to see what they suggest regarding DC powered fans with their Lutron cassa products and um this is basically what they told me also is the best option it's unfortunate because I can't control the speed of the fan this way through Apple home or through the Lutron app but um you know at least I can turn it on and off via Smart Home control automations and you know manually at the wall which is important to me plus I'm able to separate the light and the fan to two separate switches at the wall then if you ever want to adjust the speed of the fan you'll just have to use the remote for that now what about those of you who have a single wall switch that controls both the ceiling fan and the light together or what if you have one of those weird single gang combo switches with the dial or dimmers like that all right well if you have only a single switch that controls them both there is not much you can do on the switch side to split them and give you independent control of the light and the fan short of you know running new wires for a whole new switch from you know the light to the wall your best option here may be to use some sort of relay installed directly in the ceiling fan I did this recently at a friend's house that only had a single switch to control the fan and the light using the new accara T2 dual relay I was able to split the fan and the light and control them independently through the app or apple home which is awesome there are other relays out there that would also work and uh you know some of which I have not tried some I've heard will even allow for fan speed control through the relay uh so you might want to look into that uh if you do use the acara t2 relay it will just be a simple onoff control of both the light and the fan regardless of any relay that you use here if that fan is still wired to a switch like in the case of my friend's house the switch can always be cut off which would kill the connection to your relay which which is not good so you'll want to either wire that switch to be always hot or cover it up you know so no one uses it I actually found a way around this that still gives me a physical wall switch so what I did is wire it in the switch boox to be always hot then I just use a double rocker switch as a wireless switch and used automations to control the light and the fan uh that way so I did a whole video on this I'll link it up somewhere up here and also down in the description if you want to check that out next now if you have separate wiring for your light and fan but using one of those combo type switches with the dials or dimmers you might want to look at something like the meis fan light switch so this does still require separate switch wiring for the fan and the light but will allow you to use both in a single gang footprint dimming control for the light and fan speed control for the fan my favorite wall switches to use are Lutron CA but there are a number of other options out there that a Cara T2 Relay can also be used behind the wall switches to automate your fans or light switches without having to change the actual switches you know to a different style so maybe you have some unique you know style of switches that you want to keep using just another option if you want to go that route although it sometimes seems as complicated as ever to automate our ceiling fans with all of the options and configurations out there it's also most likely possible thanks to the variety of smart home devices and tools that we have uh you know regardless of your setup it might just require a little bit of extra thought and planning and kind of looking into your existing wiring and setup a big shout out to all my channel members that continue to support me each month uh it's because of you I'm able to continue making these videos our conversations and your suggestions in the Discord server is what inspired this video and also helped me in figuring out some of this on my own smart home Journey you know who you are thanks again to

    "transcript": "okay so we're going to take a minute here and just show you how this works uh right here is going to be your power button where you power it on and power it off you can also long press that to lock the display so this vent booster fan was sent to me at no charge for the purpose of this review they call this a smart fan uh because it does have a digital readout you can set this program this how you want it to work it also has a remote control going to show you all that here in just a minute but what this does is replaces your old vent now your it should be a 4 in wide by 10 in hole that you're going to be inserting this in so I've pulled my old vent out so it should just slip right in here nice and easy just like that currently the air coming out of here so right here we're getting 74° that's what's coming out of the vent right now uh we do not have our air conditioning on yet I'm putting that off just as long as possible to save as many dollars and cents as I can so uh we're hoping that this is going to help cool things down just a little bit it's got an extra long power cord on it okay so we're going to take a minute here and just show you how this works uh right here is going to be your power button where you power it on and power it off you can also long press that to lock the display so nobody can come around and kick hit any of these buttons and change any of your settings you long press that to take it back off of the lock and then what we have here is underneath here is the menu button when you push your menu you're going to toggle through your fan your cool air and your hot air and we want to go here to our cool air the number that you see here 75 is going to be your room temperature to set your room temperature you're going to long press the mode button and then you can set that to whatever temperature you would like it to be then over here on the right hand side down the lower corner you're going to see two little bars here and those bars are your fan speed that fan speed is going to kick up when you are 5° off of your set temperature so if I wanted to I could manually increase that fan speed all the way up to high and then it is going to manual then it is going to automatically adjust the fan speed based on the room temperature so it says that the room temperature is currently 75 once that drops down a couple of degrees this is going to drop down to the default two bars on the fan we do have a nighttime mode and the nighttime mode is going to be a low fan speed and it's also going to have the display go dark we can also turn lights on and off using the light button right here now all of these features can also be controlled by the remote control as well so we can turn our so we can turn our light on using the remote control turn it off we can set our temperature and once we set our temperature we're just going to let it set until it goes back to the room temperature we can change our wind speed we can crank that up and it will just toggle on through we can lock our display unlock it we can turn it to heat cool fan or we can put it on the sleep mode right here with the remote as well all of this is going to be automatic that's why they call it a smart fan and so it's a pretty neat little unit here I really like it and uh I'm hoping that it's going to help save on some of my utility costs so if you're looking for a vent booster this smart fan right here uh definitely is something to consider"

    "transcript": "this is Trio's new ceiling fan smart silent like a ninja great features cool design and great value especially for a price point it brings so much to the table for so little money in it we have a brushless DC motor which provides not only a lot of power but also smooth and Silent performance in both directions yeah and this makes it great for not only nighttime usage but also for many other applications such as office and Studio tasks you can let this fan run during calls or even during filming videos to enjoy a cool breeze without any noise drawbacks you can regulate the light from cold blue all the way to warm orange and you can also dim it both over a remote and also completely stepless it is smart home ready very efficient available in different sizes and colors so yeah looks and sounds amazing right but is it actually that good let's find out new drip got the new drip from the Rio their latest smart ceiling fan and by the way if you're interested already then check out the product links in the description I will listen link the best deals for you yeah now let's check it out so here we have the box it's quite large but it's not that heavy as you can see you can leave this alone easily and as you can see there were a lot of stickers on here we have this side right here and down here it says white that's actually the front side right there this fan looks awesome smart home ready and the precise model and lastly we have this side right here with all the small print the company and the app oh yeah and not to forget that's also something that I want to show you on top we have this and also what's interesting is the energy guide first time I'm seeing this very interesting so as you can see super efficient and yearly cost just seven bucks that's nothing so let's open it up just a few cards on top and just like that I can unfold it right here check this out we have the contents of the Box pretty dope and on top we have all the paperwork right there and also all the blades and all the parts so check it out all the blades right there and also the cutouts in the styrofoam for all sorts of smaller parts so let me grab all of that GL all out put it here and the blades five in total then this will come out and then in here we have the rest of the parts remote cover bracket and the base right there that's the heaviest part and that's it so right there I will clean up so here we have all the parts but before we get to it let's check out the accessories and the manual this one we already saw that is a great explosion drawing right there and we have the same right here with the quick guide and there is also an installation video available and we have the back of the quick start guide and we also have a user manual front and back 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and there we go and other than that we will also get a remote control with all the parts which includes a wall mount and of course the screws so the remote looks like this really nice buttons main light timer color temperature and fan control we have this on the back protections and also this for the battery so now it's active this is the wall holder for it and the remote will slide in nicely and we also have a little guide for the remote right there as well as screws and glue pads or you know adhesive pads so first of all we have the ceiling bracket looks like this and this will get screwed to the ceiling next we have the down Rod ball this is basically the pivot point for the whole device and we also have a second Rod this one is 6 in and the other one is 4 in long so we have 2 in of adjustability then we already have the cover it's just a slide on well screw in place canopy and for the yolk we also have a cover looks like that then on the main base nice it can already rotate and first of all this right here is a temperature set Sor right here of course all these holes air vents and here we have the rotating part as you can hear there is nothing to hear and it rotates extremely freely we have the connectors the plugs and here of course all the arms for the blades talking about blades they look awesome really nice design on the downside we have this touch of wood right there and the mounting Point looks like that so we have this spring-loaded guide rod and you will basically just slide them in and fix the screws and last this is the actual lamp all of that was a fan and now finally we have the LED system 24 ws and all the small print right there with the connectors that will connect to the base this will screw on and the light looks like that looks really nice here we have the parts for the blades to lock them in place securely and we also get parts for the ceiling bracket to connect the cables and long screws and with dead set let's put it all together this looks quite intuitive to me I don't think I will need the video but they suggest to start from the top start with the bracket and then put it together step by step to the bottom the light will be the last part so before we switch locations a few closeups so this will just slide in it has a cutout this will lock it in place that's the mechanism right there for the main base we can slide out this and we can remove the rod looks like this and we can insert the cables pull them through all the way nice thick cables okay we need also need to unscrew these screws then we can slide this through and lock it in place just like that but I actually want to have mine near the ceiling so I will exchange the rod right away and it's super simple just unscrew these screws right there two of them in total and now this thing will simply it will simply slide down so I will grab this piece insert it into the short one slide it in like that check it out and now I can screw in the screws one will actually go into the thread and the other other one will be a set screw and we'll just hold it in place like that no need to go super hard on this one so the cables all the way through the rod just like that secur it in place now it's Wiggly and with the set screws with the pointy set screws now it's locked in place nicely just like that firm connection so we have the cables going and with these you can basically screw them together but I will be using something like this that's bit more convenient with the screw ones you just screw both cables together and then screw it on but this one is a bit more elegent you slide it in all the way and then lock it in place just like that and the last one there should be more than enough place inside of the bracket the bracket comes with a grounding cable we are ready to move places and I just realized that I have to take this out again so that I can fit in this cover but anyways but at least this way you will know which mistakes to avoid so the order of assembly is this part then this part then you can slide in the rod Slide the cables through connect them to some sort of a clamp we have a caution right there as well and now we can take this part and just slide it into the bracket and this was actually the very first part just marking the holes with the bracket and drilling them and screwing in the screws now would also be the time to remove this so let's do this right now bend the cables out of the way and now I can just slide it in and there we go so the green one is mess we we have the white one as the neutral and the last one we have a big cover so it's easy to tuck it all in I will wrap it around and then just move the cover up and this one will basically rotate in place and lock now I can slide down the other one and that's that inserting the blades is also super simple and straightforward you just need to open up this and you can already slide it in press the knob it will pop in and then you can clamp it in place I will go diagonally just like that clamp it in place so this assembling this fan is also really simple just do it the other way around if you need to remove it or if you want to move it okay and the last one there we go okay now I can Center it and look at that absolutely no noise it's silent and the last puzzle piece is of course the lamp so let's plug it in right tuck it in and then screw it in place as you heard it will pop in place as well and there we go okay let's bring back the power and as you can see it will work right away done with the unboxing and with the setup and now let's get to my first impressions and then of course to a close overview wow now look at this thing it's looking absolutely beautiful this is my office area right here with all my instruments and my workstations but this beautiful white design might actually fit better in my all-white bedroom yep and that's my lamp cover right there but anyways this Timeless and great looking design will obviously fit pretty much everywhere and all in all I think it looks really sleek and refined definitely a very nice looking fan so yeah let's take a close look from underneath it will look like this so beautiful shapes and forms and of course the light let's turn it on check this out we can dim it we can make it brighter we have feedback and we also can cycle the Kelvin the iPhone wi balance will react immediately but in contrast to the window I think it's more noticeable and number one speed one actually let's stop that again so when it's rotating it looking like this and there is no sound coming from it whatsoever when it will spin up faster then it will of course be a bit more noticeable but goes without saying I guess now look at this awesome design looks so cool so yeah this is it from the side we can see all the blades these nice shapes curvatures and outlines and of course everything is neatly covered there are no cables visible the insulation worked out really nicely and as you can see great amount of motion right there this is of course needed to cancel out all the vibrations so yeah looks dope not bad right so let's check out the app all the functionalities and then of course test it so as you can see we have six levels of rotation speed so let's start with one and as you can hear there is nothing to here it's very silent I will go all the way to it no absolutely silent on stage one and we can also change up the rotation and there we go and this is actually the correct way for Downstream oh my goodness so that's already a nice breeze on stage one and again it's completely silent and now let's switch it up to Stage six and mess up all my all my stuff right there look at that it's barely holding on I was thinking that this might fly away that is quite intense that is stage six and with the middle button we can turn it off and as you heard even the max stage isn't that loud again we can turn off and on the light and with the minus we can dim it down let's switch the Kelvin now so yeah you can see a bit better now because the white balance won't react immediately to it so we have orange much more orange and more into the white neutral white and then cold blue yeah now you can see it nicely these are the steps for the color temperature we also have oh we also have an RGB no way so we can also cycle through different RGB colors and we can also turn off the light and only go with the RGB actually see the white balance of the iPhone that's crazy how can it remove this anyway so purple off red orange yellow green blue darker blue and this purple again yeah nice nice with this button right here we can change up the direction of rotation let's turn on the light again I definitely need this in my bedroom and lastly we also have a timer 1 4 or 8 hours then it will automatically turn off yeah now let's also check out the app heung is the publisher there is only one app you can't go wrong so let's open it up and there we go so agree to that and first of all let's create an account for me this would be Austria and email and let's go that's fine so there we go we have four tabs we have the kitchen tab right there we also have the Discover tab many cool products right there love that and we have the me tab where we can connect to Alexa or Google Assistant to make this fan fully smart so let's add a device give it all the permissions and we already have it right there ceiling fan let's click on it and check it out it just reacted next give it all the permissions and let's log into the Wi-Fi and let's connect and by the way the fan is currently cycling through the color temperatures as a sign that is communicating I guess so we are connecting all the way and just like that it's done and we have the white model the black one looks really cool as well check this out okay we are done okay next okay next and timer pull down to refresh and there we go so pull down to refresh we have the timer right there oh and here we can set up a more detailed timer nice we can turn off the light completely and turn it on again and we have oh we have scenes right there nice so let's see the fan is off and with the app we can steplessly dim the light that's really cool and we can also steplessly select the color temperature so with the app we have way more choices and possibilities and options than with the remote but for quick access the remote is fine as well of course and here we also have a color wheel for choosing the RGB light so we have the color wheel for millions of colors and we can even let it breathe so bit faster awesome right and we can also go for the rainbow fade right there and we can even set the brightness and again so now you can see it very nice rainbow fade right there and we can also turn off the beep now it won't beep as you can hear but beeping is okay and we can also save this as a scene for example really dope so with just one press we can cycle through a preset that we can just create really cool we also have bedtime light this will fade out over a period of 60 minutes max and we can also set up schedules to turn on the fan for a specific period of time or for a period really cool start time end time all of that good stuff that is a really nice app I have to say and lastly let's check out the settings so here we can change the color we can rename the device right there we can share it and we can also check the Wii we can also check the F version that's fine and we can also check out the user manual just in case in case you forget how to disassemble it really nice the app is great and right here for example we can connect to Smart assistance just like that with just one press of a button give it the permission and then you can also turn on the fan via the Google assist and by the way we also have quite a few settings for the fan right here we have 12 steps we have Auto normal natural and sleep so sleep is of course the super silent mode and we can reverse the direction of the fan right here if you want to blast the air upwards to cycle the warm trapped air in in Winter for example you can do this too and we always have little descriptions right there that will explain everything in detail very nice so that is a great looking and great working app I am amazed so all in all the trio ceiling fan gets a massive thumbs up from my side it looks awesome performs very well and I as I said I am very impressed by this product so much value especially for this price point absolutely incredible so as you saw it not only looks great but also the hardware and build quality is just topnotch the design all in all looks awesome and the installation was quick simple and easy just a great product on all levels and also a massive quality of life upgrade if you have either no ceiling fan at all or just an old one so this device combines a fully customizable light source with a fully customizable silent fan which is also smart home ready but of course you also have the remote to pick and choose speeds color temperatures and of course for dimming it and also for all sorts of other settings of course and this motor in here oh my goodness it is next level it provides so much power you can create fairly strong winds in your room but for this amount of power it is still very very silent especially on lower RPM you cannot hear it whatsoever and what's also great is the fact that you can actually reverse the rotation the direction of rotation turning this fan into an all yearound usable fan because this way you can use it during winter times as well to circulate the warm air that is usually trapped near the ceiling the brushless design also makes it very efficient and the newest Led Tech just adds to the power saving nature of this device so yeah all in all the trio ceiling fans are definitely drippy check out the product links in the description if you're interested I will listen link the best deals for you but before you go smash that like button then subscribe ring the bell and click all to never miss amazing Tech magnet videos that's it for this one and show you then I will see you soon"

    "transcript": "hey everyone I'm going to do an unboxing today we have a black smart fan it is the swirl 54 in and it's nice because they just operate on constant power they have a remote but they're also compatible with Alexa Google smart things and ecoe so this fan is outdoor rated or wet location rated sorry which can be installed outside they just recommend that you don't still don't install it in high moisture or high corrosive environments which we are not super high in humidity we're in Alberta we're not super high humidity and we are not like our air is not salty like it would be on the coast so it would totally work outside I've installed these before on client houses out on uh like almost lakefront and and I had not heard anything bad about it so I recommended them to go with the wack [Music] fan so you just have a little bit of protection there you got your you got your manuals here and then you got your light kit with your this is your Dome your cover for the light kit this is the canopy that goes up to the ceiling constructions this is the canopy that covers the top of the fan this is the remote kit it looks like yeah here's your remote with a cool magnetic mount for the [Music] remote and mounting for the for that then we have the um module that runs the fan now if you take the styrofoam out I'll put that where it's not going to blow away now we get into the fun parts we have the fan motor itself so we've got the fan motor itself we have the this is the bracket that the light kit mounts to bracket that goes to the ceiling so this will get mounted up onto the ceiling this is the covers for the screws so this goes on the top of the ceiling canopy the included rod so the included Rod some hardware and then we got the Glorious fan blades so here is the white fan blades to match the sofit and they're a pretty close pretty close match for the s so we've got our three fan blades outdoor fans I always recommend to do plastic or metal you don't want to do wood outside cuz wood will just it will take the moisture and absorb it and it won't be they won't be good in a very short term very short period of time whereas at least plastic or metal will hold up being outside but yeah that's what you get when when you buy a fan so we've got our constructions we've got the this goes on the top of here this goes underneath so it goes like that then we've got this goes on the ceiling to the top and we got our light kit and this goes here so we've got two screw holes this goes here to cover your screws that way you don't see your screws we are now going to assemble The Wack swirl 54in fan I gave the manual a quick peruse so that I know what I'm doing cuz nothing is more off F and not knowing what you're [Music] doing every fan is a little bit different but they're usually fairly close to the same but some like some you have to install the blades after it's up cuz you can't do it beforehand but majority of fans are going to assemble the same way that we are going to do it today so once you have everything unpackaged and laid out it's just a matter of getting everything set up and ready to go so we'll open up our bag and so here's all of our screws for the fan blades wack fans especially the swirl are fantastically easy to assemble they're one of my favorite fans they're very simple they're very robust fans and I just I've always loved their fans so it's just a matter of lining up your your holes here they only line up on one set of holes so it's just getting them lined up and then putting your screws in I like to go outside of Blade to outside of Blade and then if there's the third one in the middle you do the third one in the middle so now with this particular fan we have to flip it over because there is screws in the other side of the blades as well so we'll just pick it up we'll flip it over and this should make sure that everything is aligned perfectly [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now with these with this particular fan it is easiest to install the light kit now rather than trying to do it upside down when it's already up a lot of fans you can actually totally assemble on the ground and then hang it up do your connections and install your canopy that way it actually cuts down on a lot of the ladder work now we'll get the light kit installed first we have to install the plate so we need to remove one of the screws out just hang on to it you're G to loosen off these two other screws then you're going to take this guy slide it over top and just use your keyholes and then rotate it so that you can see your third screw hole and reinstall your screws and snug them back down [Music] now that that is installed now we'll go with the light kit [Music] here so first things first line it up it looks like we'll have to take probably two of those screws out so we'll remove two screws just put those to the side where you're not going to lose them loosen off your third screw next up we'll connect our wires if you can you can peel it back a little bit to see but they so you can match up your blue with your blue and your white with your white this one is blue this one is white then this should just tuck underneath the plate [Music] and there we [Music] go and take a flathead even and try to move your wire underneath the canopy but you want it sitting flush and it shouldn't be hard to make it sit in FLH so if you need to twist it up a little bit just to make it fit and there we go sitting nice and [Music] flush next up is just reinstall your two screws you took out which is awful cuz they're Phillips and everybody hates Phillips especially sausage fingers here still sitting flush and it snugged up a little bit put our other screw back in which it's not lining up it's not lining up just back off your other screw at a touch it'll move your plate or allow your light kit to move around and [Music] then if you're lucky it'll go easy if not it's a pain there we go so now we've got all three in you can tighten them down you don't have to kill them they have a lock washer on them they just need to be I just go a touch more than snug last step for the bottom side of your fan is to just put your your cover on your light cover on and that's done so the bottom side is all looked after now this is what you'll see you see no screws or anything nothing rubs now we'll just flip it back over now it's working on the back side so first thing you're going to need is your [Music] rod and take off whatever elastics they have [Music] here it's not needed and just retighten down your screws tighten this one down next up you're going to loosen off screw number one these are set screws in order to hold everything nice and [Music] tight so we'll back off the two set screws and then these disassemble they're pretty simple doesn't look like we need to take it take off the ground sometimes you need to remove the ground the first is to back this this set screw off actually sorry first is let's remove our this is our bottom pin next is we backed off the set screw so it comes your collar Your Rod just slides up and you take out your other set your other pin you remove your pin and lift your your ball mount off now you should just be left with your down Rod this is also if you wanted to put in a longer down Rod you would just use your new down rod and reassemble everything as you go the same way that we're going to do do now so we'll take all of the covers off I also like that they Supply a very long safety wire a lot of fans don't Supply a long enough safety wire if you were to go with a different down Rod so if you went with a 12in or 24-in down Rod a lot of other companies the down Rod act or the safety wire would not actually reach outside of the down Rod it only works on the included 4-in one untangle this a little bit here so here's our safety wire oh WRA around the fan blade here's our safety wire we'll move that over here now we're going to take off untangle our motor and light wires so motor is the three colors we've got red gray and yellow is for the motor and then we've got blue and white are for the for the [Music] light so we just untangled [Music] them a little challenging because we're a little chilly out it's around freezing so wires don't want to cooperate but we've got them all straightened out now what we're going to do is we're going to take everything together and threaded goes down and we're just going to shove we're just going to slide all of the wires and the safety wire [Music] through just have some patience there's a lot of [Music] wire but just thread it through once you get it down you can thread in your thread in your Rod some rods thread in some just slide in and then your PIN is what holds it but you're going to thread it so that you can get your pin through [Music] it I think we're too far I think we're about there so next you're going to take your PIN with your cotter pin and you're just going to wiggle it through there that way you don't push any wreck any wires put your washer back on and put your cotter pin back in now take your screwdriver again and you're going to tighten down these two set screws so if you don't tighten down these two set screws fans are prone to wobble more so we'll just snug down those two set screws next thing we need is the canopy that hides all the [Music] top we will take this the wires and same thing we're just going to thread them through the [Music] canopy have patience and pull it through now your grommet just will slide down your Rod here it should there we go slides down hides everything nicely next step is not this please please not that where is it here it is next step is your screw cover don't forget your screw cover super easy you have to undo all of your wiring take it all down and change remove everything that we're about to do so do not forget your cover and it installs like this because your screw heads need to be covered so so make sure that when you're putting this on another simple way a little bit bigger of a hole you pull like so make sure that when you install it you can see the screw holes and it goes just on the top next up the big canopy this will hide all of our wires and remote and I'm just going to do the same thing we're just going to pull our wires through so we'll pull it through and that's good and this goes like that so see how this will be up and then your your other ring will go on very important like I say otherwise you have to undo everything that we're about to do it's not a lot of fun I have forgotten it and I've had to redo stuff and it's why ceiling fans take as long as they do next up we're going to put our ball mount back on if you can get your wires to go through in the middle again it's the simplest and you can just pull your extra Loop through this goes down next now if you recall how we took it all apart this is your Golden Rod you can't lose the Golden Rod if you lose the Golden Rod nothing works what happens is you put your Rod through like so and you take your ball out and you hold it up against it now you just tighten down your set screw now a lot of people are going to say how does that hold how does that everything is held by friction because this is how it mounts so your PIN will hold everything no matter what cuz you will not lift this fan and the set screw is just there for extra [Music] insurance and that's it the main fan is assembled this goes up on your fan box on the ceiling so this will go up there then all you do is you hook it like so so you're just going to take this if I didn't suck so you just take your ceiling mount and it slides like so and you will rotate it so that it locks in like so and that's basically all it is to it you hook up your hook up your remote with your extra wire here make sure to mount your safety chain that way if the worst case happens this can hold everything and then it's just test it and go from there so next up I'm going to get my ladder set up and we're going to install [Music] this"

    "transcript": "with Springtime here now's the perfect time to add ceiling fans to your smart home to help circulate the air and keep your home cool when it comes to Apple home you've got options and by the end of this video you'll be better equipped to decide which fits your home best if you've already got a ceiling fan then you may be able to just move that into Apple home using a Smart Switch you've got some options but that will depend on your wiring do you have one switch or two and is your fan compatible with a Smart Switch or just get a ceiling fan with hom kit support already built in I've tested it all so stick around and let's jump [Music] in so what's even the benefit of having your fan an apple home I mean most modern fans come with a remote control so they're easy to control but we can do better than that make your iPhone Apple watch homepod and even your Apple TV into a remote for your fan so you can include it in your homekit scenes and automations I set my bedroom fanal low when I set my good night scene as I'm getting ready for bed you can create schedules to turn your fan on adjust the speed or turn it off at a particular time of the day or create an automation to turn your fan on when your home reaches a certain temperature I've been using this Hunter simple connect fan for a couple of years now and to me the benefits of having a fan in apple home are worth the cost and the effort so even if you're in a position where you're not able to do this right now this video will start getting you thinking about what's best for you and if you're patient you can probably purchase something on sale so you basically have two options to choose from Smart fan or Smart Switch if you already have a standard fan that you like then you can save a lot of money by just using that existing fan and adding a Smart Switch so let's start there most Homes at least where I live have a single switch that controls both the light and the fan but it's possible that you have separate switches side by side one for each or even a single gang with two switches the whole idea for this video started with this switch that Mara sent me this is a twoin one switch for a fan in a light and I thought this is perfect because my daughter's been asking for a fan in her room but it didn't quite work out as planned so I went to Costco and I bought a fan I got the hunter Overture 52-in fan and it cost me around $250 Canadian this isn't a smart fan that's part of Hunter's simple connect lineup but I like my original fan so much that I want to get the same brand I find hund to be quiet wobble free and honestly I just really like the way they look first of all let me tell you I hate installing ceiling fans it's really a pain supporting the fan while connecting the wires and pushing them up into the box While you hang the fan could be really challenging I suggest get help if you can to cut to the chase this miror switch didn't work for two reasons first of all I foolishly thought that this switch would magically control my light and my fan separately but it requires a separate wire in your wall for both the light and the fan of course it requires separate wires but who has a single gang double switch I mean it must exist or Maris wouldn't make a switch for this purpose but even the electrician I hired said that was really strange oh yeah I had to get an electrican help for this one this project kept getting more expensive it was a couple of hundred doar for a guy to come into my attic and add a wire from the fixture and feed it down through the wall to the light box the second issue comes down to the fan and this is important for Lutron cassa as well these smart fan switches only work with AC Motors not DC which is the norm for most newer modern fans it can be challenging to know if your fan is AC or DC because often it's not specified typically DC fans come with more than three speeds and include a remote control AC fans on the other hand typically have a pull chain so you may have to do some research to see if your current fan is compatible if you're buying a new fan then just opt for one with a pole chain the bonus is that it's often cheaper in the case of the mara switch using it with the DC fan I could turn the fan on but I couldn't adjust the speed at this point is when I started looking into Lutron viewers of the channel know that I'm obsessed with the Lutron cassada reliability they do require a bridge but if you're planning on adding multiple switches throughout your home then it's well worth it I didn't see anything on the Lutron website about fan compatibility so I decided to give it a try so I installed the cassa fan switch which looks similar to the original cassa dimmer switches but the icons have a fan instead of a light for the light wires I Capp them together more on that later unfortunately I had the same issue as I did with the mea switch I could control the power but not the speed sure enough in the instruction manual there's a note saying not to use with fans that have an integrated fan and speed control other than pull chains and not to use with DC fans and since this fan has a remote it has an integrated fan speed controller so unfortunately this Fan's not going to work so this time I found one on amazon.com I wanted something white with around 50in blades and I wanted to ensure it included a19 light bulbs not integrated lights like some have again I stuck with Hunter this one is called the Aniston I bought this on amazon.com as it wasn't available in Canada with SH thing and Duty it came to around $250 Canadian still less than the original one I bought from Costco so I wasn't happy to have another fan to install but it was totally worth it to finally get this working in apple home just know I did all this work for you so you can learn from my completely preventable ridiculous mistakes I think that's worth to subscribe don't you okay so here's my final setup I've got this beautiful white Hunter Aniston fan it's connected to a Lutron cassa fan switch and I've also connected a Pico remote again with the fan decals for simpler controls even though she's got a homepod mini in this room physical controls especially with kids are always helpful these Pico remotes are fantastic I have them all over the place for lights usually for three-way switches you can just stick this on a wall out of face plate you've got to switch wherever you want it but Luton also sells these little pedestal stands and the Pico remote just slides right on top and then you can set this wherever you want and having it on a pedestal just makes it a little bit harder to lose I'm using two 1100 Lum white and color bulbs and then I've just capped the wires to get constant power and to make sure that nobody accidentally turns the switch off you controller lights she can use her phone or this homepod or a Philip 2 dimmer remote these remotes are fantastic I have them all throughout the house you can control the power you can change the brightness you can cycle through Hue scenes and as a bonus you can even set this up in apple home though you are limited to a single press typically I keep this set up in the Hue app but then for the bottom off button I set this up with an apple home scene if I press the off button it'll turn off not only her Hue Lights in this room but also some of her other non Hue Lights like her omus light strip and her twinkly lights my daughter also has a flick button along her headboard she's got various lighting scenes attached to this flick button physical controls should never be overlooked now that I'm using an AC fan with a pole chain and I've had an electrician run a wire from the ceiling box over to this wall box then I could use this miror switch and it would probably work fine though just because of the reliability that cassada gives me I'm going to stick with this cada switch Lutron CA is literally number one and then Philips Hue is for me number two so having this combination of Philips Hue Lights and a CA switch literally gives me the best reliability that I could ever ask for Maris is still a great brand especially for the money but yeah I'm going to stick with Lutron CA or go all in with a smart fan this Hunter simple connect fan is one that I've been using for a couple of years and it's been great I'll leave a link to the original video I did up here this is great to just circulate the air even in the winter and at night it provides a quiet gentle breeze that makes it so much more comfortable for sleeping and has many options to choose from within their simple connect lineup and not only is the fan smart but so are the lights so basically you're getting a twoin one now this is nice but it can cause some challenges if you're like me and you like to use Smart lights in your fan if you're wondering why I'm so insistent on using a smart light bulb when this Hunter Fan and even that miror switch are capable of not only powering your lights but dimming your lights well color's nice but for me it really comes down to color temperature this is something that as I've gotten older I'm far more picky about if it's dull outside I want bright clear white light that makes it look like the sun is pouring in from outside on the other hand in the evening I want more calm warm light as I wind down for bed white temperature is critical and more important than color let me know in the comments if you agree I'm once again using philli H lights in this fan and it's not a problem except I need to make sure that the hunter fan light stays on in apple home that means I can't just say Siri turn off my lights because it'll turn off not only my Hue Lights but also the hunter fan light which means the next time I go to turn on my Hue lights the lights won't work I'm using a Phillips Hue remote in here as well and one thing I didn't mention last time is that when I turn these lights on it automatically turns the lights on to the correct white temperature based on the time of day so you're going to get brighter white lights during the day and then dimmer warmer light in the evening of course that's all customizable in the Hue app I'm in my onu bathroom right now and I just want to show you the updated Philips H Doomer in case you're interested in picking one up I definitely recommend if you have Philips H lights then get yourself a dimmer to make sure that nobody accidentally turns the light switch off I'm using a Lutron Aurora this is helpful because if the light switch is off not only is it going to affect the lights not turning on but your Fan's not going to work either so this is perfect for blocking the light switch into the on position I can also control the power just by tapping it and it's got a dimmer on here it looks just like a rotary dimmer so it's super easy to use for you your family and even guests again if you've got Philips Hue Lights I definitely recommend get a Lutron Aurora lastly for physical controls I've got this flick button right here that controls my lights and then for the fan I've got a remote control that came with the simple connect fan right here guys I know I say this all the time but physical controls are so important for controlling your smart home please don't rely on Siri the pros of having a simple connect fan and I'm going to leave out the build quality of Hunter because I'm also using a hunter fan with the Lutron switch in my daughter's bedroom but just know that Hunter is one of the best and I haven't had any issues with no response errors okay both the light and the fan are automatically smart there's no need to worry about whether your fan motors AC or DC or does it have a pull chain it doesn't matter there's no need to wire a new Switch just make make sure that your existing light switch is left in the on position that also means you don't need to buy a switch so you can save money there you're just buying a fan and Hunter includes a remote to have extra controls around your house on the con side you'll be forced to buy a brand new fan which means you'll also get to experience the joy of hanging and installing a ceiling fan costly these fans can be expensive certainly more than a standard non-smart fan this stylus model costs around $400 US also these fans aren't available in Canada the hunter website only ships to USA so if you're outside of the United States then your selection is going to be very limited I have seen some on homeed depot.ca or costco.ca but it's very hit and miss luckily if simple connect isn't available where you live then you have options I know I would be just as happy with a standard fan and then just adding a Lutron switch like we've got in my daughter's room I hope this video gave you a few things to think about on your journey to having a better smart home tell me about your setup and have you made any of the same mistakes that I shared in this video if you found the video helpful then it helps me to give the video a like And subscribe for more Apple home content that's it for this week thank you so much for watching and I'll talk to you [Music] soon"

    "transcript": "So, this is the Coolify Cyber. It's supposed to blow cold air around your neck and your face to keep you cool during the hot summer days. So, let's check it out. So, when I took this out of the box, I thought that it was going to be pretty heavy to wear and uncomfortable uh just from the look and the design of it, but once I had it on, it was actually pretty comfortable. It does have a nice flex to it, so you can easily put it around your neck. Although the neck fan is completely made out of what seems to be like plastic, it does have a nice finish and it feels premium. So, at the top here, you have two air vents that are going to blow towards the side of your face to keep you cool and there's one air vent to blow towards the back of your head. Flipping on the other side, there's one air vent that will blow down the back of your neck. So, not only is it blowing cold air, but on the inside of the neck fan, it also gets really cold as well. On the bottom here, you have your charging port, which is a USBC."

    "transcript": "[Music] So, there's one room in my house that's just consistently hotter than the rest of the rooms in my house. And I don't really know why, but what I do know is that it makes me run my AC bill even higher, even though the rest of the house is cool, just because I'm trying to cool down one room. And of course, I have ceiling fans. I have tower fans for around the room, and I've even considered getting a portable AC unit. But before I did that, I wanted to test this out, which is Dreo's air circulator fan. This thing is really capable. super powerful. And my favorite thing about it is the fact that it can circulate the air in the room. Rather than it blowing in just one direction, maybe tilting back and forth, it can actually do a full 120° of motion both up and down and left and right. So, it can basically do a little figure 8 pattern and actually move air around your room instead of just blowing it in one direction. And man, let me tell you, after testing this thing out, it's become a very important part of my room because it's helped cooling it down a lot quicker and just having better air flow in here all around. One of the nice features that I didn't expect going into it at all because it's a fan is the fact that it has built-in LEDs. Now, this is something, of course, that isn't necessary. It doesn't change the functionality of the fan at all, but again, if you're into the smart home ecosystem stuff, more than likely, you probably like RGB lights. I know that I do. I have some here on my speakers on my desk and just kind of built in all around the house. So, the fact that this has built-in LED lights on the back of it is really cool, and it just adds even more to the ambiance of a room in a way that you wouldn't be able to with a separate LED light strip. Unboxing and setting up the fan was actually super simple. You basically just have to attach the main body of the fan to the base. The base is where all of the weight is because the main part of the fan is actually super lightweight, but of course, that does help it not tilt or fall over in any way. And then, it's literally just as simple as plugging it in to get it to work. There are some very simple ways to control it. Of course, you have the panel on the front of the fan where it just has these touch sensitive controls, and that'll give you all of the functionality that it has. You can turn it on and off, turn the light on and off, cycle through RGB colors, and you can actually use it to adjust how far you want the fan to go up or down, left and right, or if you want it to just cycle in one direction and not go up and down, for example. You can do all of those things via the touch sensitive controls. And of course, you would expect it to come with a remote, right? So, it absolutely does. It actually has a nice little clip-on attachment so you can clip the remote to the fan which I really like. I have some other DRO tower fans that have a remote but I never ended up knowing where to put it. So the fact that you can clip this directly to the fan is a really big plus. And of course you have all of the functions on the remote as well which makes it super simple. But of course it's 2025, right? So there's an even easier way to control this fan without even having to get up off of the couch. If you're someone like me who loves to have a smart home and just wants to be able to control things without having to get up and find a remote, this is actually a smart fan, too. All you have to do is download the Dreo app. Press the little plus symbol at the top. It'll automatically detect the fan once you plug it in, and then you add it to your app. Now, within the app, there's even more in-depth controls. It's actually found really cool. Firstly, of course, you can turn it on or off. You can adjust how fast you want the fan to blow, and you can fine-tune the RGB colors on the fan even more than you would be able to with the remote. But within the app, there's even better options. If you want to put this fan on a timer or on a schedule, you can basically have it turn on or off at certain times of day automatically and just basically schedule it so it does it all week long without you having to put any input in. So, if you know you're going to be out of the house for work, you just set it to turn on at 6:00 p.m. when you're home and it'll do it for you. Now, I've made videos on DRO products before. I have their tower fans, I have their smart humidifier, and now I have their air circulator fan. And I've always been really impressed by the quality of the Dreo app. It was just really well put together. It's super userfriendly and very easy to use and just a really sleek app. So, I wanted to give them points for that. And part of the app that was actually really impressive to me that I wasn't expecting at all is you can actually control how far the fan tilts side to side or up or down to the degree. So, like I said, it has 3D oscillation, meaning it can go 120 degrees left and right and 120 degrees up or down. But what makes it different from a normal oscillating fan is that you can actually set it to go a certain amount of degrees and not go the full 120°. So, if you have the fan in the corner, for example, and you only want it to blow in one specific area, you can set it to blow maybe 90° back and forth instead of going the full 120. And this is something that I really love because it just lets you fine-tune how the fan is blowing. So you can really tweak it to fit your space and wherever it's sitting in that room. If there's anything that'll be blocking it in a certain area, or if you don't want it to go all the way up, but you want it to go up and down a little bit, you can completely fine-tune it, which is really cool. I did also want to mention that this fan is very quiet. It actually goes down to as low as 20 dB, so you can basically barely hear it if you have it on the lower settings, which in my case is really important because we sleep on the bed behind me and I don't want a super loud fan going off all night. But this thing again with how quiet it is, we can have it blowing pretty decent without even affecting our quality of sleep. And it has nine different wind speeds, too. And this is something that Dreo calls turbo wind. They've actually done some tests on it, and they found that the wind blown at the top level of this fan can actually reach 90 ft away. So, again, super impressive. If you're looking for something that can really circulate air, this is going to be the best fan for it. And in addition to the nine wind speeds, you do also have six different wind modes. So there's one that's like a natural air flow, there's a consistent, there's a sleep mode, and all sorts of other things like that, which is again just another way to customize how it blows. Now, touching a little bit more on the smart home ecosystem. Like I said, you can always control this via the Dreo app, which is my preferred way to use it. I've actually kind of moved away from using some of the major smartome products like Alexa or Google Home. Of course, if that's something that you have, this does have built-in integrations in the Dreo app, so you can easily toggle it or adjust it using Alexa or your Google Home device. Honestly, when Dreo reached out to me to review this fan, I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to do it because, like I said, I already have tower fans from Dreo, and I've been using them for multiple years now. They work great for me, and since I use them so consistently, I didn't know whether or not I really needed another fan. But after talking to them a little bit and figuring out maybe this would be able to help me with the airflow issue I have in my main bedroom because it gets so hot. So I told them maybe I'd want to review one of their AC units. However, what they told me is that this has such good air flow that it might actually be able to help me with the hot bedroom issue and not even necessarily need an AC unit, which would be even more expensive. So they ended up sending me this fan and I've been absolutely impressed by it. It's definitely something I'm going to be leaving out here in the room just because it's helped so much and it honestly impressed me a lot more than I thought it would. So, in conclusion, if you're in a situation like me where you have a hotter room in your house or you're just looking for a way to cool down your space without having to invest in something like an AC unit that's a lot more bulky, this fan has worked perfectly for me. It really did solve the issue of the room being hotter. And again, with all the smart functionality, it's just another great addition to the smart home. So, make sure to check this out if you're interested in getting one. I will have the links below. And thank you very much to Dreo for sponsoring the video. I'll see you in the next one."

    "transcript": "I try to limit our reviews to products that you're going to be excited by so when dreo asked me to review a smart fan I explained very nicely that the smart fans just aren't going to be an exciting topic for a lot of people I told them no but they sent the products anyways then I took it out of the box and was blown away by how it looked then I plugged it in and I was literally blown away then I worked with it tested it thoroughly in begged drio for forgiveness and to make this review they accepted my plea for forgiveness accepted my mistake and even sponsored today's video so thanks to drill for that and I promise you'll be amazed when you see more of what these smart fans can do drio sells five fans today with two having smart features now the Falcon s table fan sitting over here has an MSRP of a hundred dollars comes in silver or gold carries a blade length of nine inches and drives those blades using a motor speed that maxes out at 1280 RPM it features nine speed settings and six modes with some automatically adjusting fan speed due to temperature or schedule or in other automated ways it's ultra quiet it's running here beside me and that's a term I don't use lightly as I'm annoyed by most noises in my home yet the air coming out of the fan actually reaches the entire length of my home even at medium speeds plus it features one of the most incredible horizontal and vertical pen and tilt options that I've seen today allowing it to move 120 degrees horizontally and 90 degrees vertically and there's more to that feature that I'll explain later and you're probably noticing if you're watching here it's not going that far is it now the Falcon s is gorgeous but it's a little large and for those of you without a side table to sit that fan on you can get the polyfan max s now it's another forty dollars but it comes with a stand an increased motor speed and a few changes on the features available here both of them come with touch screen control on the fan itself and both come with an IR based remote you can run them with sounds adjust the panel brightness a bit and you have other basic features and settings through their Wi-Fi connection and the drio app but that's where we start to get some pretty wild physical attributes and some of the smartest features I've seen ever on a home appliance so I need to show you what these things can do in person okay so I've got this running and it's just an on and off right here as you turn it on and off you can see it's actually moving back to kind of a central place now I can adjust fan speed as I'd like I can go all the way up to level nine and you can see the result right there I have the ability to adjust between Auto and normal modes here on the display and I have horizontal and vertical oscillation you get a little icon for each of those on here and you also have a timer so I can go by hours and I can go all the way around back to zero now each button has a hold function so if I hold I can go to turbo mode now that is above level nine that's as fast as you can get this thing going you also have the ability to turn on and off beeps on here you can see I've turned it on so it's muted this is how you configure it for Wi-Fi when you're getting it set up and here's a child lock so that this won't work anymore now when you're turning these on and off you can see that one's running that one's running I turn this off and it's going to kind of re-center itself same thing takes place here if I turn that off it's going to kind of re-center itself we also have a remote with all of the functions now the funny thing is this specific remote came with that you get one in each box but I can turn them both on with the same remote so there's nothing stopping me from turning them both on with one press or multiple of these and you have all of the same controls on this remote as you do on the physical device now the drio app is quite powerful so here's the tall fan and here's my air circulator so that's this one and then you saw the other one now you could just turn these on and off very quickly there it goes it's running already it's instantaneous what you might be noticing on this page is that you get a temperature sensor that's important for later but if you ever want to go in and do more of the functions you know here they all are now the two interfaces are exactly the same I can crank that up to eight and I can crank that down but you also have three other modes natural moves between different fan speeds it'll kind of act like the wind out doors you have sleep mode that just reduces over time the speed of the device and you have an automatic mode that auto mode adjusts the fan speed a little bit based off of temperature and that sensor that's on the device you also have the ability so I can control move this left or right so I moved it a little left or right but it's still vertically oscillating there so you have this ability to control it manually or you can turn on the other oscillations and now it's going to move left and right and vertically there's a turbo mode obviously that's going to drive it up and there's a custom mode that I'm going to show you a little later but this is based off the temperature in your space or you can set it based off of the schedule you can also adjust how this oscillation works so you don't have to have it oscillate all over the place voice assistants are extremely powerful with this turn off tall fan there it goes now you have way more commands that you won't expect with those voice assistants so I'm going to show you that as we continue here with our review there are five things that I am blown away by and I promise I'm done with that pun but this vertical and horizontal oscillation feature is something that has been fine-tuned within drios app you can choose both at the same time and you can also limit that movement to exactly the way you'd like so if you don't want to blow away the papers on a table you just limit the fan from going there that's what I've done here so it's not hitting me and that leads me to the second thing that's really impressive that is the control that's possible with Amazon or Google Voice assistance or within their app the voice commands you get with drills fans allow you to control the fan change the speed turn on and off that vertical and horizontal oscillations independently and as is usually the case Amazon can run those features within their routines so you can have these automated methods like pushing buttons from across the room or even using more sophisticated methods like presence or motion sensors now a great idea for Amazon as well is to use the onboard temperature sensors in their Echo speakers to make this fan behave exactly how you'd like but that's actually not even required because of the third thing that I find really impressive I was really surprised by this but drios included their own temperature sensor and then made really good use of it you can use that sensor through the drio app and this allows you to adjust the fan speed based on temperature so if you put the fan in auto mode and then let it run throughout the day it'll adjust the fan speed on its own a little bit up and a little bit down as the temperature changes but there's a more in-depth custom mode that allows you to set the fan speed exactly based on temperature this works really well with air conditioning units to have the fan speed up when that turns on and it's an absolute godsend when your home fluctuates quite a bit in terms of temperature because you can drive up the fan again when it gets too hot now of course with every smart device today I can schedule the fan over the core course of a day but I think the temperature control for me is what I'm going to use and you also have two other modes now the first one is called the natural mode which changes the fan speed every few seconds like you experience in The Great Outdoors but the fourth thing which is called sleep mode leads me into another really impressive thing about these that mode will drop the fan speed every 30 minutes until you get down to what is the lowest fan speed then it will leave it there and run until you want to shut it off now the reason that this is important is because it's so ultra quiet in these lower speeds you really can't hear it and you basically just feel it a little bit and that is so different than every other fan I've had now the fifth thing is really related to the engineering they've been engineered to be nearly silent and I don't hear the movement when it's oscillating either vertically or horizontally and it and I barely hear it even when we get up to higher speeds which speaks to what I think is a really high quality design from a physical perspective the motors are definitely high quality and just the way these fans look and the components even being used on the outside are just a little bit better than you're going to get with a standard fan that speaks a lot to the value and I don't see these as being overpriced in a world where a lot of things are overpriced and obviously it's more expensive than a 20 fan but that's a pretty hard product to come by these days and honestly there's a real feeling of luxury with these products around your home if I had any requests or anything to say about these I might stop you from looking at them when you need a fan it's that they don't work with more traditional smart home hubs today they don't seem to have any matter compatibility on the way and I would like to see that temperature sensor exposed to the other platform so I could use that in other ways now the panel brightness stays fairly consistent on this and even though it says it will adjust it but these are all minor things because it works on its own with those onboard temperature sensors and it's a top-notch smart product it's been reliable I haven't seen it go off of the Wi-Fi connection and the connection to the voice assistance has been perfect so to me these are complete buys and I really hope me taking the time to produce this review was worth it to you personally in fact after you're done checking out the links to these below please let me know if this kind of a review hit the mark for you otherwise thanks for watching today and of course don't hate automate"

    "transcript": "[Music] hey what's up Alex here you know throughout my entire time on YouTube covering smart home related products I have never touched on Smart ceiling fans before reason is simply because smart fans were not very common at the time when I was renovating this place now whenever you go to an it show you are sure to find a number of smart fans there I was also not familiar with this whole smart home setup at the time so I just bought and install some cheap normal ceiling fans after that the way I sort of make them smart is to use a IR or controller device and this device will basically do exactly what your remote control is doing it works fine for the most part but there are problems or I should say limitations with this approach based on how the remote control is designed just nice my bedroom ceiling fan has been running into some issues for quite some time really so since I decided to change it might as well take this chance to change all three of my current sailing fans to a smart one from three different companies and share with everyone my experience with them okay quick pause if you're not aware of what other things generative AI is capable of doing now you need to check out these AI voice recorder from plop node that is powered by cat GPT so cat GPT has been very helpful in our day-to-day productivity doing things like drafting email responses to doing summarization for online meetings with Google meet or Zoom they have ai features to help capture meeting minutes breaking it down into different speakers and generate a summary report what if I tell you that all of these can be applied to face tof face meetings as well every person you meet all the conversation you had including phone calls this device that you can stick at the back of a phone is able to help you remember everything all you need to do is just a press of a button all the summary results with the full audio transcript are stored inside the ploud app honestly I am mind blown when I think about the possible use cases of this you can think about it later links in the description first is a solution from a company called Big Ass Fan Yes you heard it correctly it's really called Big Ass Fan you might not hear this name before but if I say Hau fans then this name is probably more familiar to you big S fan does a lot of industrial commercial fans and Haiku is one of their residential product lines under Haiku they have quite a number of model series and what you see here is the Haiku ey in full black color 52 in size which comes with a bunch of their smart features all hio fans have a tree blade design which I find is the best looking for the installation two guys came down and took roughly an hour they also helped to dispose away my existing 40 fan the parts they use are not the typical standard ones from the other brands so they have to remove everything from the existing fan and replace it with their own I like that you can hardly see any gaps between the ceiling and the fan very slim design and overall just look very slick and modern the main differences between the H and I series are the design and material use the light kit is optional in my case I didn't get it since I don need it inside my bedroom so for the remote control I will only make use of the buttons for the fan this remote control is based on IR so you need line out sight one cool feature I found is that it has buil-in sensors it will light up the buttons when you touch it very useful at night when the room is completely dark it has seven fence speed controls one being the lowest and you can see it's really slow then I found that because hiu fans are sold globally some country trees need to push down warm air during the winter season this process called destratification helps to achieve a more consistent temperature in Singapore they typically recommend using speed six or seven one of the unique selling points is that it comes with a motion sensor so whenever it detects motion nearby it will automatically switch on then switch off when no motion is detected the detection range is just nice for me as it won't switch on if I'm just going in and out of the bathroom this setting can be found under fan Auto where you can also set the motion timeout duration okay I know you must be thinking now whether it will automatically switch off when we are sleeping since there is no motion the answer is yes so over on the app what you want to do is to configure the sleep mode you can see that once I turn on sleep mode it will then turn off the fend Auto this is also explained in the app under sleep mode there is a timer setting for it to gradually decrease the fence speed if you like so take for example on Google home what you can do is is over at your good night routine add a custom action to turn on the sleep mode then your good morning routine will turn off sleep mode which will then turn back on fan Auto personally for my case I have set automation such that whenever my akara curtain is in a closing state it will then turn off the motion sense this way I don't rely on voice commments and it also works whenever anyone is taking an afternoon net okay in terms of smart home system Integrations official support is Google home and Amazon Alexa for home assistant you can find the integration to Big s fan as well if you on homekit or smart things don't worry because it also supports mattera and I want to mention that it's really very nice of them to include the mattera setup code right inside the app if you have used meta devices you know it's a pain to manually store the code somewhere something that I hope other companies will follow as well however if you're connecting via matter you will see just a few controls so for example on home assistant this is what I see with the app integration versus this is what I see with matter I like that the Moto from Hau is very quiet and together with the sleep mode smart features overall make it really ideal putting it inside the bedroom the next smart fan is from prison plus a very well-known brand in Singapore sponsoring many local artists and influencers promoting their products as much as I really dislike their marketing strategy I'm going to be objective and give my Hest unbias review of the product product so prism offers two models the ois and ois pro the pro version basically allows more customization in the design I op for the leaf blade mat wi 46 in three blades because less is small for the Moto I find the Huger looks very bulky so I went with the more classic down Road design mat white as well smart of course and RGB lights and this fan will go to my study room so you can see that there's a little Gap here between the ceiling and the top cover this is what I'm talking about it can be because of my ceiling not being flat I'm not exactly sure another thing that I immediately notice when I compare with my existing fan is the size of the LED light prison one is a lot smaller which is fine for the size of this study room for the remote control I'm surprised that it looks so similar to the one from big S fan but it has ledd lights to show you the current fan speed and light brightness level another difference is the prison one is based on RF so you don't need line on sight I tested how far the remote can be away from the fan and still able to control it and realize that the distance is pretty short so the fan has six fan speeds I would say that the max speed is slightly stronger than one from big S fan but the noise is also louder besides the standard three-tone light it has the option for RGB light which is quite special I don't think other fans out there have this besides them you can change to some of the presets directly from the remote here are some of them personally I don't find the rhm ones look particularly great going to just stick to to a single light we hardly ever switch on this light anyway so it's fine okay coming to the app they want you to use their prison plus Connect app but technically since this is a Toya based product you can always use the Smart Life app instead they customize their app in such a way that it only supports these four device types which I don't really understand their intention here they also remove the sins tab which can find it in the Smart Life app where it allows you to create scenes and automation rules all those good stuff so my guess is the prison plus Connect app is simply for non-smart home users because as I mentioned before nobody at home is going to just take the phone unlock the phone go to an app to just control the fan this is not smart at all smart home users will add a fan on the Smart Life app I'm not sure why it always prompt the wig Wi-Fi signal notification on the app you have a tab to control the lights another tab for fan controls then there is also a shedu and settings tab here which you don't need everything works fine on the Smart Life app which you can then integrate to a smart home system one good thing for prism is you can easily use the government climate vouchers to offset the price of the fan for my case I paid just $150 for it which I find reasonable for the price last product is from another Singapore company called po1 I actually never heard of this company before the reason why I decided to try them out is because when I go shoppy to do a search on Smart ceiling fans they came out on top of the search result at the same time the design of their Cyclone series is something that I'm looking for in my living room the reviews seem very positive as well so I decided to give them a short a small little complaint I have is the installer came pretty late was told between 300 to 5:00 p.m. but only arrived at around 5:15 p.m. it was about to rain at that time so the footage you see here is a bit dark luckily he is very good at his job managed to quickly finish the drilling and fix up the fan in about 30 minutes I was mindful of the gap between the ceiling from previous experience I pointed that out to him and he did manage to resolve that as well after doing some adjustment you can see it looks really similar now it has a very similar design concept as the hu just that the top part is thicker and also the LED light cover is a little too round for my liking the remote control doesn't look as fancy as the previous tool but I actually like that it has dedicated buttons for each fence speed initially I have difficulty setting the brightness level that I want then I realized the best way is to press and hold the buttons and here you see the brightness going up or down nicely this remote control is based on RF and the range is much better than prisms so there are six fan speeds even speed Tre which is the medium it's already a lot faster than what I experienced before what you see now is at Max Speed it's hard to show how strong it is but one thing you can see is the whole fan still remain very sturdy despite going at such high speed for the lights I'm able to compare it with the Oasis easily here for brightness level they are more or less around the same but one thing you can spot the difference is the shadow flickering issue that is actually very common in many ceiling fans for the ois it's very obvious the lights are shining onto the blades and you see big Shadows cast on the ceiling and on the walls very easily then I look at a cyclone this is actually considered very M just a bit on the ceiling and if I position my camera this way for a side by-side comparison then it's pretty clear that the way the Cyclone fan is designed is able to reduce this Shadow flickering issue to the minimum in terms of smart home controls it's also a Toya based product but it doesn't have its own app so just use the Smart Life app you only have a few controls here very straightforward I would say this is definitely easy enough for an elderly to understand the UI interface one benefit of using a smart fan is you're able to sing the on or off indicator lights on Smart Switch take for example my akara Z1 Pro switch here when switch is on switch LD light is on turn on the ceiling fan light okay this is basic but what if I manually use the remote control to turn it off you can see that the switch is able to go to the off State as well and off the LED indicator so this is something that you are unable to achieve with an IR or R receiver something to note for home assistant users is that the default 2yr integration which is V 2 Cloud won't have controls to the fan you will have to implement local Toya this involves going to the tuya developer platform to test out the controls and then manually configure every entity controls you want on home assistant you will need to spend some time to figure this out okay some quick summary points for each of these smart fans the Hau ey from big S fan has a very quiet Moto comes with buil-in motion sensor best for smart home with matter support but price is high The Oasis Pro from prison Plus is probably the only smart fan with RGB lights switching on the lights will have a flickering Shadow issue and the app is lacking smart home features lastly on the Cyclone from point1 it has very strong fence speed which helps a lot during the hot Seasons easy controls on the Smart Life app overall good value for money to conclude I will say that all these three smart fans are good in their own ways and the price kind of matches with the features you get if I'm moving to a new house today I will definitely install Smart fans instead of using the IR or RF approach so I would highly recommend it for people looking to build a smart home implement this early and don't waste the money buying the non-smart versions first all right that's all from me see you in the next one very soon bye [Music]"

    "transcript": "All right. So, what you see in front of you is 715 on the extreme right side. Then we got 704, this one here. And then we got 513S, that's one in white color. How to help you with that? Oops. Uh, all right. So, let me tell you some pros and cons and come to the direct conclusion. But if you don't want to watch the whole video, let me tell you what. This one is better. This one is worst. This one is okay. Um there's another thing. This particular model which is again right here 513S has been really popular. That's where I got to know about RA in the first place. But all the reviews I mean not all I would say 80% of the reviews online are fake. Yes, they they either pay for the reviews or you get the free free product in the exchange of review. Um, but they're good. They actually work. The uh airflow is much much better with this version, which is 704. Uh, I got the spec sheet here so I can quickly walk you through what I mean by that. The blade size in all three of these is 9 in. So that is good. So I would consider anything above 513 and I mean above 513 or which is basically two more models left after 513, 704 and 715. Um the vertical oscillation you get the best one with this 704. Um horizontal oscillation also you get the best with the 704 right. Um, as you can see here, uh, let me pause this video really quick so you can see the complete oscillation cycle, uh, in fast [Music] motion. All right, one more thing that I forgot to mention about is the height. So when they are fully extended out um it stands around at 45 in. This one stands around at 42 in and this one around at 43 or 44 in. So this one kind of looks short right short right now because um like this look it's as simple as that. And what you do is just tighten this bolt. So notch and you're good to go. That's a height difference. This is the maximum you can get. Uh this one is the tallest one I have seen in comparison to these two. Probably this is the tallest one you can buy from this company. Uh one more thing is you get black remote with these two and you get the white remote with uh white one if you're buying white. Um, let me turn everything off and uh let's see. Oops. All right. So, now they are off. Let me show you something interesting here. Uh, it's serviceable. You can pretty much remove it. As you can see, lock, unlock. Um, there is a screw at the bottom. You have to take out the screw and pretty much you can take out the whole assembly uh for the cleaning. Um this one the 7151 has two blades in it. You see this is the one blade the transparent one and the blue one right here. So that's what they are claiming that they have dual blade technology that reduces the noise which works which is true. This one produces the least amount of noise when compared to these two but again at the sacrifice of air flow. So what's the point of that? To get the proper air flow as these two, you have to increase the speed and it's going to make noise. Anyways, so that's what I was talking about when it says gimmicky. U this one pretty much has one single blade. Uh very simple design. Nothing complicated like these. Again, um this one also has um very simple design. Just one single fan in there. The controls are on the top. And for these two, I already showed you the controls are here and here. All right, let's do the sound test. So, we'll start with the 715. This one, we're going to press the start button here, and we are going to turn it all the way to max. So, So that's a sound. Um you can also use the remotes for the same. Uh one remote can control all of these. So if I let's say turn off, turn back on. So all right, let's do the noise test or the sound test for the 715. No, sorry, it's 512s. So, let's turn it on and speed to max. Now, let's turn down the oscillations, too. All right. from the same sitting position. That's a noise coming out of 512 as you can see. Now, let's turn this off. Right. Let's do the sound test for the 704s. Go ahead. Turn that on. Max. Perfect. Without any doubt, this one has the highest air flow. You can literally feel the wind. Good. Um, also another thing is that this one has nine settings. As you can see, it has number nine here. Uh, this one has eight, I guess, from 1 to eight. And this one has 10 different settings from Z 1 to 10. But it's all gimmicky. The bottom line is this one has the best air flow. It doesn't matter what speed you are on at um if you max them out. So So go ahead. All right. So those videos were sped up and then I slowed it down to uh make you guys see um how the oscillation works with these. Um, another thing that I found with uh this particular model 704 which is really good, the airflow is best in that one, but the build quality is really poor. Uh, what I mean by that is probably I don't know if you can hear it, but yeah, that's what I'm talking about. So the thing where it um um it's attached to the stem that whole part it's kind of loose now I wouldn't say loose but it's it makes a lot of noise. It's completely made of made of plastic and plastic is going to make noise as if it's a rattling noise coming out of your car interiors if you have older car. Uh this one is pretty much the same but at least it doesn't make noise when it is oscillating. This one sometimes makes noise. It's like a ticking noise and it it has been a well-known issue with this 704s. Uh a lot of you can find a lot of comments on um Amazon as well. A lot of people are talking about this. This guy over here is the best one. This is like their flagship model which is 715s. And the problem with this is that they did a lot of good things with it, right? So you can see uh the touch panel is fancy, the display is better quality. Um versus the 704 where you have the touch controls as well, but the display is right here. You can barely see it, but it kind of looks cool though. But anyways, um so that's where you keep your remote. Um, but the problem with this is the airflow is not even close to what you get from here. So, I'm barely running it on speed number one. That one is also on speed number one. And this one is barely pushing any air out of it. Right? Um, if I put it on number four, then that's the same amount of air that you get out of 715 versus when you put this on number one, the 704, right? So again, 704 on number one will push the same amount of air that you get from 715 at number four setting. That's crazy. Another thing with this is that it doesn't oscillate uh vertically in all the angles. I mean I would say it starts from zero to um 85. I think that's the range. This one goes all the way um I I don't know what's the probably you can see it from here but it can go all the way here like this. Look. Yeah, you can see that. So, it's going to blast the air right on the floor or let's say if you're slipping on the floor, then this is the best choice to go with. This one does not. This one does not oscillate all the way to the down as you saw with the 704s. These are going to just be vertical straight. All right. Um, these are also good. Uh, they can also blast the air on the floor. Uh, as the one that I saw here, probably you can see it now. It's going to tilt all the way. Perfect. Yeah. But only difference between these two is the tilt angle. This one has much better tilt angle as you can see right here versus that one. So that's a plus point. Also, another thing I don't really have a flow meter to measure the air flow coming out of them. But um what I can tell you from what I feel um this one has much higher flow rate than compared to these two. So number one, number two, this is the least with the number three. Um here's the app. Pretty much you can customize everything in the app, right? It's very cool. It's one of the best app I've ever seen for the fans at least. Um yeah, as I was saying. So we are at this one 704 and if you click on a angle so you get 150 um horizontal angles um rotation or oscillation whatever you call that you can even get the oymmetric ones like this like this. It's up to you. So let me put put it back to 150. Uh same with the vertical oscillation. So with the vertical ones, um, you get all the way up to, um, um, 120, right? So that's cool thing. Now, let me go back to, um, this guy over here, 715, which is the most expensive one that they have. Um, it can only go up to 120, not 150. And the vertical oscillation is 30, 60, and 85. So, that's the biggest downside with the 705 ones. Um, uh, let me go back to this one here. Um, this guy, um, you know what? Let me, for example, let me, um, sorry, let me turn the oscillation off. And then you can pretty much set the 3D angle the way you want. So it goes all the way up then the down like this right and it oscillates. So these are the different vertical and horizontal angle that I was just talking about. And uh if I go back to to this one, right? 3D angles and all right. So all the way up, down. Oops, sorry. Down. Yeah, this this angle is what I really find important because if you're sitting on a sofa, if you have it in the living room or if someone is sleeping on the floor just in case someone guest or someone then this angle is best. This is why I'm keeping this one for sure in my bed uh in my bedroom. Sorry, in my living room. And that one probably is going to be in my living room. I'm going to read on this crap. It's not even worth it. Um, now let me move back from the app and let me let's talk about the price a little bit. So, this one is selling for $199. Absolutely not worth it. Uh, right now on Amazon, you can check that out. It's $161. It's uh they're running some promo or something. Um, this one is getting sold around at $130 to $150, which is okay. That one is $140.

    "transcript": "at 200 the new 52 inch aerodyne smart fan from Hunter is one of the most affordable options on the market and I think it looks really good my name is Eric weilander welcome to my channel so recently when my old ceiling fan I got with my house ended up dying I replaced it with a new smart fan from Hunter with my own money now is this a better option than using a fan control installed in your wall which is something I've talked about previously on this channel so we'll talk about that also my experience using the fan and if you stick around to the end of the video I want to show you how I've also integrated this smart fan with Philips Hue smart bulbs so Hunter has a line of simple connect smart fans and this means that they're also compatible with apple homekit now at the time of filming this video I haven't seen concrete plans from Hunter about when or if they'll support matter but they do support pretty much all the major smart home ecosystems including Apple's home kit now with a home kit compatible fan there are some advantages over a smart fan control in your wall the first is that you can set the direction of the fan inside of the home app and this can be nice if you have a furnace running in the winter I'm told that running the fan in the reverse Direction helps the airflow for the heat to move around your home now another obvious benefit you get with a smart fan is of course a new fan so depending on the age of your fan and whether you like it or not looking at a smart fan could be a nice way to both upgrade your fan and get it smart control another advantage of a smart fan is that it can work in scenarios where you might have combined wiring for both a light and a fan together the smart fan can separate those two out whereas you might not then in that case have a dedicated spot for a fan control on your wall but there are some downsides of having a smart fan one of which is that you're probably going to have still a light switch on the wall that can cut power to the fan and the light and that means that the fan will go offline from your smart home if someone turns the power off so I've put covers over the light switches on my wall that control this fan the other downside is that sometimes in the past the fans have had the reputation of having flaky Wi-Fi connections and not working too well in my experience once I dialed in the Wi-Fi settings just right everything's been working great but we'll talk more about the settings I'm using for that in just a minute so installing the fan is very straightforward I found the instructions which come in a paper manual very easy to follow now as I mentioned earlier the wiring does support scenarios of if you have dedicated wires for the fan and the light or the same circuit for both and you can probably do this alone they have sort of this nice setup with I think more modern ceiling fans in general where they can kind of hang in the socket before you actually screw everything in so you don't need to have like a second person there holding up the fan the whole time you're getting the wires all set and it comes with a 2 inch inch and a three inch down Rod which is that sort of metal pipe that goes between the actual fan unit and then the part that connects to the ceiling the three inch Rod is pre-installed but you can also change it out for the two inch one and if you need a longer down Rod you can get those direct from Hunter's website now before getting into the smart home side of the features you can also adjust the fan with the wireless remote provided in the box and one of the things I've been really impressed with from the fan perspective of performance is that it can work really well at high speeds and it's just very quiet and stable I think that's back to the benefit of getting a new fan sometimes when you're upgrading a lot of these older fans you'll be surprised about the good performance and just benefits of fan technology that have marched forward over the years now adding this fan to your smart home you want to download Hunter simple Connect app and follow the instructions there and then add it in to your Apple Smart Home in order to get it to work reliably on your network I would highly recommend giving it a static or dedicated IP address this basically means that every time the fan connects to your network it gets the same address on your network and pretty much any wireless router system has ways to do that so look into that for yours if you haven't done it already and for networking nerds out there maybe you have a ubiquity system like I do I found with trial and error that turning off pmf or protected management frames seem to help the fan be connected more reliably but maybe that's just all placebo effect and wasn't actually something that helped of course one of the annoying things about the hunter apis you have to set up an account when you're going through the setup process is just one more username and password to keep track of but then once I got the fan added to my Apple smart home one of the other things I notice is just that adjusting the brightness this of the lights which is possible on this fan just didn't seem to work out so well with the light bulbs that were provided in the box and one of the setups my family really gotten used to using in our living room is a Lutron Aurora dimmer which is actually something that works with Philips hue light bulbs so that way they could touch the dimmer on the wall and then the lights in the living room both from the lamp as well as the ceiling fan would all come on and they could adjust the brightness in sync across those different light bulbs and maybe if you are into Philips Hue Lights as well you might have Philips hue light bulbs in your ceiling fan that you're hoping to replace with a smart fan so there's a little bit of home kit trickery that I did to make this all work out nicely now even if you're not interested in using Philips Hue bulb specifically with a smart ceiling fan I think there's some ideas here that you might be able to take and make some really cool automations of your own with this similar kind of a setup so I'm here in the living room in the home app and if you notice there aren't any ceiling fans here I have fan light one and fan light 2 and if I tap in on the details of those you can see that those are actually the Philips hue light bulbs so what happened to the fan and the light that I have in my living room well if you have a home pod in that room and you've added lights to that specific room in the home app and then you ask the homepod to turn off the lights or turn on the lights the homepod's gonna go find those lights in the home app or you know in home kit and turn them on or off and the problem there is if you turn off the lights on the fan that's going to cut the power to the Philips hue light bulbs but on the other hand you want the actual fan to seem as if it's in the living room because you want to be able to talk to the homepod to command the fan speed or fan being on and off or anything else you might want to control and then the problem of course is even though you can show the lights and the ceiling fan as separate tiles home kit won't let you put them in separate rooms so if you have the ceiling fan in your living room room then those lights that you don't want to turn off I get added that room as well so in order to solve this I actually added the ceiling fan into a room called ceiling fans in home kit even though it's physically still in my living room now if I go here to the ceiling fan you'll see I have the controls here to adjust the direction as well as the speed on and off of the fan so that all works just fine you might also notice that I have the name of the fan being living room ceiling fan so that way if someone talks to the homepod and asks for it turn on the living room ceiling fan or whatever blah blah blah living room ceiling fan then it will still work but then the lights are called always-on Hunter lights so that way if someone else in my home sees this they understand that these lights should be always on because these lights are what's powering the Hue bulbs that I actually use for the lights so if we scroll into the details here you'll see that I've also added an Automation and this happens when the ceiling fans always on Hunter lights which are these lights when those turn off it triggers an automation that turns on a scene called Hunter lights on so if these lights were to ever turn off from some kind of a smart home command that automation would trip and then a few seconds later the lights would come back on therefore restoring the connection of the Philips Hue bulbs in that light fixture so well all this seems kind of complicated I just keep these ceiling fans over here and I could have more than just one ceiling fan as long as I'm giving it a name that corresponds to that particular room let's say parents bedroom ceiling fan and of course if I wanted to add any scenes in the living room that also controlled the fan I can certainly do that so let's say every time I wanted to turn on my living room bright scene which wouldn't really put a ceiling fan there but just go with me here if I add or remove accessories then I can scroll down of course and add the living room ceiling fan to that scene so is this Hunter aerodyne the right choice for your home when you're looking for a smart fan and I think at 200 the decor seems like pretty minimal and it would fit in a lot of different homes and styles so that's probably going to be a good option for you and then the simple connect wireless system if you're willing to just make sure it works well with your smart home I think it could be a really good fit because it gives you more detailed control over a fan than something like a Lutron fan control on your wall now that said it took me a lot of effort to just get this customized just how I want it for my smart home as you saw I added Phillips Hue and then also had to troubleshoot a little bit to get to work well on my Wi-Fi and I put the switch covers over the switches in the wall so you might see all those things and think that you could do the same and make a great smart fan setup in your home but you also might see all that and think that's a whole lot of trouble that you just don't want to deal with so that choice is up to you let me know in the comments below if you had to get a new smart fan tomorrow would you get a Lutron fan control with a not smart fan or would you get something like a smart fan itself like this Hunter aerodyne give this video a thumbs up if you liked it Sophia here122 subscribe to the channel if you aren't already thanks again so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

    "transcript": "hey guys today we are back with drio and this is one of their smart ceiling fans model clf 712s in this review I'll go over all of its features and its performance and provide my personal thoughts at the end now I will disclose before I begin that this fan was sent to me by drio as a review sample but they otherwise did not have any influence on my review recently drio has been releasing products with smart feature integration that allows you to connect the products to the drio app and have more control control over them now one of these products is the polyfam 502s which I also reviewed recently on this channel you can find a video in the description below now the clf 712s is one of their newest releases it is a five-bladed ceiling fan featuring an LED light kit and a remote control now this model is offered in two different colors black and white but this unit right here is of course the white one to start off installing the fan was straightforward and relatively hasslefree if you want to see me install fing the fan I made a kind of a vlog type video on the ceiling fan swap out in my sister's room so check out the video in the description below this fan is currently installed as I mentioned in my sister's room and this gave both myself and my sister the opportunity to test it and develop an opinion on it which I'll share in a bit aesthetically this fan has a modern design but still with some elements of a traditional style ceiling fan the blades are made of plastic with a full wood I would say this is something like a bleached Oak style print on one of theid sides and this is a non-reversible blade set they have an exceptional blade pitch with a modern curved profile that blends in quite well with the adjacent blades and the rest of the fan as a whole driving these blades is a brushless DC motor cranking out 640 CFM on high speed the fan also has a timer setting that will run for a specified time before shutting off the light kit is an integrated LED unit and the brightness and the color temperature can be adjusted to your liking the light goes up to 2400 lumens which is is plenty adequate to comfortably illuminate the small to medium siiz room now this light Dome is rather flat so it will only disperse the light below the fan so that will result in the area above the fan being quite dark now this fan also has something pretty cool an RGB light ring now this feature offers a range of colors that you can choose from and I have to say it looks pretty cool the included remote control works quite well with good range and it gives you control over most of the feature that the fan has to offer now let's talk about the smart features of the fan to enable these features you'll need to connect to the doo app which is a quick and easy procedure after downloading the app press and hold the light power and the light color temperature button on the remote for around 5 seconds and the fan will begin to cycle through different color temperatures indicating that it's ready for pairing next just follow the steps on the app to finish connecting so here in the dreo app you have full control over the fan and even gaining access to more precise controls that you don't have with the remote control such as adjusting the RGB color with the color wheel and the light brightness by exact percentage you also get access to sleep natural and autof fan modes as well as a customizable run schedule e e for for the airf flow from the fan is quite impressive this room is about 13x 15 ft and it's more than powerful enough to blow sheets of paper off the table even in the far corner cor noise Wise It's very quiet on the lower speeds but it does pick up on speeds five and especially six now comparing it to the sound of a traditional wooden blade ceiling fan I find that this Trio has more of a hollow whizzing sound and this is subjective but I personally find this to be a little bit less Pleasant to listen to now tying into that now I'll go over what I like about the fan and what I don't so first off the plastic blades tend to Creak a little bit whenever the fan is picking up speed or slowing down and sometimes randomly when a fan is running and it can be pretty loud and obnoxious take a listen to this the next thing is the motor often stutters when it's starting up which actually is a normal behavior for a DC motor ceiling fan but I find that this Dro occasionally just takes a little too too long to start up due to the stutter sometimes as long as 5 to 10 seconds just to get moving and I've seen other manufacturers have DC motor ceiling fans that seem to not have a stutter or seem to manage the stutter better so I hope that drio can look into this and make some improvements on it also by default this fan beeps with every button press you make on the remote and it's quite earpiercing and quite annoying but thankfully it can be turned off by pressing and holding the light color temperature button on the remote for around 3 to 5 seconds but I wish that D would have made this the default and if you wanted to you could turn on the beeps because I don't think very many people would want to hear this beep every time they press a button especially when it's a quiet room but aside from those Nuance is I think this is a great fan it performs well and I like the broad range of features that you get with it especially for the current retail price of just under $200 us and also my sister has been using this fan on a daily basis and so far she's been very happy with it the smart features and the ability to control the fan from your phone are nice to have if you find them convenient this fan like most other Doo smart products will also work with Google home and Amazon Alexa now I personally don't use these smart features myself but if you do they work extremely well as far as reliability and Longevity is concerned only time will tell but if anything does happen with the fan later on I'll note it in the description below so be sure to check it out for updates so to wrap up this video I would say if you're in the market for a ceiling fan that Bridges the gap between modern and traditional appearance but with the latest features and smart home integration I think the doo clf 712s is a great choice I want to thank drio for making today's video possible if you want to check out the clf 72s I'll have all of the links that you need to check it out down below in the description and thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

    "transcript": "so have noticed that most pedestal fan designs are pretty similar except this one but is their performance similar too I've got an anemometer here but also a de meter one shows me the speed of the wind passing through the turbine in kilm per hour or m/ second so basically we will test the wind speed these fans will produce the other one is just as important the deciel meter which will measure how noisy these fans really are and we want to sleep while having these on too so the lower the better first off let's introduce them the first one and the most expensive one is the one we've all seen and want the Dyson tp00 cool but don't get it twisted it doesn't cool at all it's just a regular fan like all the others then we have the Rowenta turbo silence which looks like a fancy upgrade of one of the more traditional fan designs out there which also happens to be the bestselling model on Amazon next in line is the fuve FF 920w the xiaomi me smart standing fan 2 and the duk's whisper finally we have the E dream small and foldable fan for reference these are the prizes of each model I will go over each one in more detail and after that I will discuss the findings with the anomer and also the sound it produces more scientifically starting with the Dyson at around €400 sometimes on sale for 300 I think back when these were first introduced everyone wanted one but actually a small percentage of people actually got one at its very steep price it's definitely a niche product but I would spend that kind of money on a fan if it was actually better sadly the though that's just not the case here I was really unpleasantly surprised about its build quality the top part is a cheap feeling plastic and it clicks on top of the base when pushing this thing around it actually is surprisingly stable though you could also argue that because it rotates and is pretty tall it should be light so if we look through that what else is there does the remote work well for example well no its range is very crappy too it looks very premium but that's about it sometimes it won't even recognize the fact that I'm pressing it it has a physical button on the fan as well but that's only used for on or off and you can hold it down to adjust the speed not the rotation and then to add insult to injury [Music] the fan makes a lot of noise for the least amount of wind speed out of all the ones here more on that later to be fair the price is also for the fact that it has a built-in air purifier which is a cool concept but the air purifier filters are just as expensive as you would imagine at around €70 per filter as a comparison my Phillips filter replacement is around €20 there is obviously no way of having it swing vertically so it's only horizontal which I must say looks very satisfying because it swings very smoothly from left to right there is also no easy way to move it because I think it would damage over time if you would just lifted up by the plastic top part and lifting this thing up by its base every time is a headache too it's not controlled by an app only the remote which snaps on the top with a few weak magnets but overall pretty cool and thought out finally it does not remember the setting you headed at it will reset every time you unplug it the fact that it does not even remember at which setting you had it is quite upsetting actually then at around € 10000 we have the Rowenta very often on sale for around 60 to70 though I think if we're talking just build quality this one is definitely the best but that is mostly because of the material Choice While most here have a plastic build this one has has an aluminium one and with a solid and heavy base you can adjust the height but it's not something you would likely change often it only has horizontal swing but you can angle it manually too which will allow you to choose a vertical angle at the head it has this stop for if you want it to just focus at one spot on the control panel just beneath the head you have this knob which you can turn which are very basic three speeds a night mode and a turbo mode turbo is BAS basically speed 4 in this case and the night mode is basically speed zero once enabled it will light up the night mode logo which is annoying for if you want to have a fully dark room at night I was surprised at how high this fan can go it can be really tall if you wanted to and it doesn't feel weak while doing it or fragile when you push it around a little bit the big downside for me with this fan is the fact that even night mode is still a little too much wind I would like to customize it a little more with at least like 10 modes if we're talking speed the Rowenta does have the most awkward handle like ever on a fan 2 when grabbing this thing you almost feel as if your hand is inside the cage and there isn't even enough room then once you lift it the head will rotate so I always grab it by its interface but that's weird right finally you won't have the remember function since it works with a physical button so it's always back to off anyway next in line is the Duke's whisper which sells at around €120 we had to change setting here because I had to send back my new Duke's whisper because it had some problems the build quality leaves something to be desired in my opinion it's a little fragile shakes a lot when you gently push it around and you can notice it in its all plastic build then again if we compare it with the Dyson I think for the €20 mark Dukes actually delivers good value here but I'm sure they can improve just so slightly and still make a good profit the design of this thing is very good and honestly I like it the best out of the ones here it changed the game for Unique looking fans and at that it has been very successful with 26 different wind speeds there is always one you like so it has that customizability I look for even though I feel like it could have been 15 speeds since the difference is so subtle when you have 26 different speeds it could have been easier in my opinion the remote also works just as crappy as with the Dyson with a very small range and sometimes doesn't even register being pressed this one is just a regular one you have ones with the battery as well but I cannot recommend these if you wish to know more about that go watch my other video on the duk's whisper itself it has this futuristic looking button on the base which you can turn to set the speed and turn it on or off the Duke's whisper can swing both horizontally and vertically at the same time it also remembers what your last setting was which is superior now this would be my second model since the first was written off on the noise it made after months of usage and the second one we have here did not work anymore after a year of usage so for me it does not have the best track record but I'm willing to accept that it could be just my bad luck still I would recommend you keep that in mind when you're making your purchase decision next up is the fuve FF 920w at around €90 which is often on sale for around 60 this one looks very similar to The Duke's whisper in my opinion but unlike the Duke's whisper it actually has buttons on the base which are touch sensitive the only big downside is that with every touch it makes this beep which can be absolutely annoying if you want to set your desired setting at night which is guaranteed to wake everyone up it also doesn't remember your last setting making you press it again and again the remote works fairly decent and nothing too special here again and the range isn't that good but it's still better than the Dyson or the Dukes it does have a light off mode for the night so that's a big plus the wind speeds are kind of weird actually the modes are called sleep natural and intelligent now the sleep is obvious just a little quieter than it already is but makes the wind speed significantly less to the point I never use it because it doesn't produce enough winds to keep me comfortable on the hot day day the natural mode is also a little weird in my opinion it tries to mimic The Winds of nature where they come and go yet it doesn't work this feature was first introduced to me on the Duke's whisper which they have done very well but here it's nothing more than a gimmick as it only turns down the speed in my opinion I always set this fan on a regular mode and adjust the speed according to my liking now as far as making a cracking sound with the vertical swing I haven't tested it as long as I've tested the Duke's whisper so I cannot yet comment on that with certainty but it already makes some cracks at the end of the Left Right cycle so I can imagine it will be similar still I will update you on that in the comments the fan is also adjustable in height similarly to the Duke's whisper I am not sure which fan was here first but they do look very similar on pretty much every front funny enough this one has 24 speeds and not the 26 like the Dukes but still very similar here too once again it could be done in 15 speeds everything above that is just Marketing in my opinion when talking build quality I think I would prefer this one over the Dukes it's just as plasticky but it feels sturdier overall the design is a little less but yet it doesn't look as ugly as the regular fans do it still has that new design look two more fans to go and then we're done next we have the xiaomi Mi fan 2 and this this is the EU model sold at around €100 as for build quality this one is quite sturdy actually you wouldn't think that if you see the pictures online it looks as if it's fully made of plastic but it's not the stand is actually made of aluminum which makes it a lot stronger in my opinion and also doesn't feel as cheap it has physical buttons on the head which will allow you to select wind speed one to four the oscillation from left to right only horizontal and the timer of course there is a power button too the buttons were great actually but the sound these buttons produce is unmatched it's very annoying and I've noticed that if you repeat it it will actually be worse like every fourth time so don't come near this thing when there's people sleeping luckily there isn't any big LEDs to keep you awake so the sound the buttons produce could be its only downside I think it looks pretty modern too especially if you already have that kind of interior design going on this thing will fit right in it also has an app from where you can control it which is pretty cool for this price point and even the Dyson at €400 does not come with an app which is absolutely Bonkers if you think about it there is no handle or anything but you can grab it at the stand which is really solid and this thing isn't heavy at all so taking this fan to another room is really easy now you can also adjust the head vertically but once again this is done manually and probably before you turn it on but when you do it's a smooth experience and done without steps or clicks last but not least this funny foldable fan with a battery now this thing comes in at €5 but internationally I've seen it at$ 20 to $50 because there are so many brands that sell it and they have a few variations going on so it's hard to pinpoint a specific price here it's called the E dream fan and you can fold this thing up to a really small size perfect for travel or on the go scarios when I bought this thing I really thought it would not even stack up to the rest but it's actually a really good and handy little fan rechargeable via micro USB there is probably ones out there with USBC too so that's something you want to keep in mind extendable up to 97 CM this thing is really as tall as the rest too the head is of course a little smaller so the radius at which it will operate is also a little smaller it does not rotate but you can rotate it manually like I said this thing is made for portability so it could even fit in your backpack if you so desire and that brings me to the final part of this video the sound and wind tests what is very obvious to me is that the Dyson is the worst by far While most of them have at least 1.5 m/s at the normal speed Dyson only gets up to 0.9 m/s doing so at 39.1 DB which is only top by the Renta at 47.8 DB but this fan produces three times the wind speed at that level so it's really not a fair comparison because of all the different measurement units worldwide I would say that around 2 m/s is comfortable at like 30° c as a breeze for the really unforgiving weather the second measurement at around 2.5 to 4 m/s will work for some but keep in mind that around 4 m/s it feels more like you're getting into winds rather than a calm relaxing Breeze and most will produce significantly more noise which for me also is pretty annoying I would never use the Renta fan at full speed since it almost makes as much noise as a portable air conditioning unit I hope this video helped you make your purchase decision if you have any questions let me know and if you want to watch more check out this video here and I'll see you there"

    "transcript": "let's look how to short list the best BLC ceiling fans for your home starting with understanding what size to buy the size of the fan is based on the size of the fan blades the most common size is 1200 mm or 47 in this is suitable for small to medium siiz rooms or living rooms only for large rooms like large bedrooms or larger living rooms you can go for a, 1400 mm or a 55 in size for even larger rooms like combined living and dining rooms you should go for two fans instead for smaller rooms a smaller sweep size of 900 mm is sufficient next we have to determine how much electricity the fan consumes BLC fans consume 30 to 40% lower electricity compared to non-blc fans non-blc fans consume about 50 to 60 wats of electricity and have a 1 to four star rating while BLC fans consume between 30 to 40 wats of electricity and are all five star rated so the running cost of a non-blc fan will be about 40% higher than BLC fans for example if you're running a fan for 10 hours a day your electricity bill from the non bldc fan will be about 125 rupees per month or 1,500 rupees per year compared to that for a BLC fan it will be 72 rupes per month or 864 rupees per year considering that we run fans for over 10 plus years we can recover The Upfront cost of a BLC fan in less than 2 to 5 years depending on the price of the fan that you buy so amongst the BLC fans company compared most of the atomberg BLC fans consume the least electricity while the hav efficien Neo consumes the least most of the premium fans that have a better air delivery efficiency consume almost 30% higher electricity speaking about efficiency typically the efficiency can be measured using two key parameters the air delivery rate which shows how well the air is circulated across the room higher is better and the second is the rotations permanent or RPM which tells us how fast the fan must move to deliver the cool air the ideal combination is a high air delivery rate with a low RPM the worst combination is the low air delivery rate with a high RPM which would make the fan quite noisy amongst the BLC fans compared premium fans like polycap silencio Cruise attenberg AIS Contour NEX drift and Orient electric aerosense have the best efficiency a high air delivery rate with a low RPM budget fans from Activa both the Gracia and energia as well as the Orient itom Pro and superan A1 have a low air delivery rate at a high RPM so not much recommended next let's talk about the fan blades three blade options are the most common 4 plus blades can be considered if you would like to reduce the noise level by the fan for the same performance all the fans that we've compared are three blade options many of them have four blade variants as well if you prefer that that in my last video many of you asked about the noise levels of BLC fans these fans make much lower noise compared to regular fans and have lesser changes in speed and noise level due to voltage fluctuations if the fan has plastic blades it makes even lower noise compared to the ones with aluminium blades that most fans use amongst the BLC fans compared only a few fans that you see on the screen have blades made of plastic most of them at a premium price point let's talk about some value features now now reverse rotation is a unique feature that not many fans offer this is useful when you would like to use the fan in Winter mainly to circulate warm air from the top to bottom and more importantly for people for whom the sound of the fan is important for sleeping only polycap fans and some Orient and Super Fan variants have this feature as a part of the remote a remote is available in all BLC fans these days some premium BLC fans that you see on the screen also have Smart Home capab abilities which allow you to control the fan remotely using your phone useful if you would like to turn on the fan remotely to cool the room before you reach home the number of fan speeds is another important aspect some Super Fan BLC fans have up to 25 speed settings not sure who needs it though most other fans have five to seven speed settings which is good enough in my opinion now let's discuss installation service and warranty installation is not included in the price of the fan across various Brands service levels VAR based on the brand and specifically the city that you stay in looking at feedback from thousands of users some of the traditional fan Brands like Crompton Usha and Orient have the best service network followed by newer Brands like atomberg vard and polycap service of Activa which is a lowcost brand needs Improvement and cool and next are newer and Niche brands for whom serviceability is not yet proven atur one of the most popular BLC fan brands has complaints of slow service response times and slow warranty claims warranty in general is 2 to 3 years across brand with Super Fan giving the best warranty of 5 years 3,000 to 4,000 Rupees is a sweet spot for BLC fans where you get the best price to value now that we understand everything we have to consider while buying a ceiling fan here are my top recommendations for the best BLC ceiling fans please don't assume atomberg have sponsored this video as they are in all segments of my recommendation it is only because they are the leading player in BLC fans none of my comparison videos are sponsored at a budget under 3,000 I have two recommendations for you first two fans from atomberg which are at the same price point and have same core capabilities but look a little bit different the atomberg amaza and the atomberg ficio alpha both these fans use only 28 W power deliver 230 cubic m per minute airf flow at 365 RPM and includes a remote with Boost timer and sleep modes the only difference is that the fio Alpha has an LED speed indicator and the amaza does not my second recommendation is the Activa Gracia compared to the atur models recommended earlier this has a lower air flow at 225 cubic met per minute at a higher RPM 380 so is expected to be a little more noisy than the atomberg it also includes an LED light for speed indicator while the pricing is very attractive many viewers are unhappy with the after salale service and spare parts of this fan though in the mid segment range between 3,000 to 42,000 I have two recommendations for you again first is the atur ranessa compared to the budget offerings this BLC fans offers a better air flow at a lower RPM which is good it also comes in many attractive colors to suit the decor of your house in addition the warranty is higher than the budget variant as well if you would like a smart fan then the atur ranesa smart is an option to consider which allows you to control your fan remotely from your phone my next recommendation is the polycap vzy Neo while the electricity consumption is higher than the atomberg variants this polycap vzy Neo BLC fan has a reverse mode which allows you to run the fan in Winters too for air circulation without making the room too cold now coming to the premium segment I have three recommendations for you in this segment in addition to Aesthetics which is obviously better the biggest benefit of the fans in this seg segment is that they offer the best air flow with the least RPM so better cooling with lesser noise but these do consume about 30% more power than the other variants that we recommended my first recommendation is the atomberg Aris Contour this fan has an air delivery rate of 250 cubic m per minute one of the highest and also has smart home capabilities a smart remote and LED light in the fan asthetically this fan looks good and it has also received Design Awards from India design Mark and Red Dot my next recommendation is the polycap silencio cruiser which again has a good air delivery rate at a low RPM it has seven speed adjustments including a boost mode in the remote a timer and a reverse mode for all your use and my last recommendation is the Orient electric aerosense this fan has the lowest RPM compared to all the other fans that we have researched so less noisy for a good air delivery rate aesthetically this is also one of the better looking fans and gives the best warranty of 5 years this is also one of the most expensive fans that I have compared if you're looking for an air cooler or an AC instead you may want
